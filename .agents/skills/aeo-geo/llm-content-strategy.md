# LLM Content Strategy — AI-First Content Framework

## Overview

A content strategy specifically designed to build brand authority in AI-generated answers. Focuses on creating content that AI models trust, cite, and accurately represent.

**Design for Google AI Mode, not just AI Overviews (mid-2026):** AI Mode — the conversational search surface that became the default for opted-in users at I/O (19 May 2026) on a Gemini 3.5 Flash backbone — is a **distinct surface** that cites differently than AI Overviews and supports multi-turn follow-ups. Structure each authority piece so it answers the headline query cleanly *and* holds up to the obvious follow-ups (definitions, comparisons, edge cases, "how do I actually do this"). Publishing structured, **dated** updates on owned channels also makes a brand more legible to the user-configured AI Information Agents launching for AI Pro / Ultra in summer 2026. Audit AI Mode and AI Overviews separately and reconcile actual impressions via `/digital-marketing-pro:gsc-ai-performance`.

## Topical Authority Mapping

### Methodology

1. **Define core topics** (3-5 primary topics the brand should own in AI answers)
2. **Map subtopics** for each core topic (10-20 subtopics per core)
3. **Audit existing coverage** (which subtopics have quality content vs gaps)
4. **Check AI citation status** (which subtopics generate AI answers citing brand content)
5. **Prioritize gaps** (high-value subtopics where brand has no coverage)

### Authority Score Per Topic

For each core topic, score:

| Signal | Weight | Scoring |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Content depth (word count, detail level) | 20% | 0-10 |
| Content freshness (last updated) | 15% | 0-10 |
| Unique data/insights | 20% | 0-10 |
| Expert authorship | 15% | 0-10 |
| External citations (backlinks, media mentions) | 15% | 0-10 |
| Schema markup coverage | 10% | 0-10 |
| AI citation rate | 5% | 0-10 |

**Authority Score** = Weighted average × 10 (0-100 scale)

## Content Gap Analysis for AI Visibility

### Gap Types

1. **Coverage gap**: Topic exists but brand has no content on it
2. **Depth gap**: Content exists but is too shallow vs what AI cites
3. **Freshness gap**: Content is outdated (AI prefers recent, dated sources)
4. **Authority gap**: Content lacks expert signals (no author credentials, no data)
5. **Structure gap**: Content isn't formatted for AI parsing (no schema, poor headings)
6. **Entity gap**: Content doesn't connect to the brand's knowledge graph entity

### Prioritization Matrix

Score each gap: **Impact** (how much AI visibility would improve) × **Effort** (how hard to fix)

| Priority | Impact | Effort | Action |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|
| P1 — Quick wins | High | Low | Fix immediately (schema, freshness, formatting) |
| P2 — Strategic | High | High | Plan content creation (new pillar content) |
| P3 — Opportunistic | Low | Low | Batch with other updates |
| P4 — Defer | Low | High | Backlog unless resources allow |
