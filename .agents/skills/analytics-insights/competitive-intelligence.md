# Competitive Intelligence — Monitoring & Analysis

> **Benchmark provenance (as of 2026-08):** Dollar figures in this document are planning priors, not quotes — market and auction rates drift continuously. Before any figure enters a media plan, budget, or client deliverable, refresh it live (platform dashboards and current published reports beat memory) and record it with `python scripts/benchmark_book.py --action record ... --source <url>`; quote from the book thereafter (`--action quote`). Never present an unstamped figure as current market fact.

## Purpose

Competitive intelligence is not about copying competitors. It is about understanding the market landscape to make better-informed strategic decisions — identifying gaps, anticipating threats, and finding positioning advantages that competitors have missed.

## Competitive Response Playbooks

### Playbook: Competitor Launches Price Cut

1. **Assess scope** — Is it a temporary promotion or permanent price change?
2. **Measure impact** — Monitor your CVR, traffic, and branded search volume for 2 weeks
3. **Analyze margins** — Can the competitor sustain this price? Check their funding/financial position
4. **Response options:**
   - Do nothing (if your differentiation is strong and CVR is stable)
   - Match selectively (discount for competitive switchers only, not existing customers)
   - Add value (bundle, extended warranty, better support) instead of cutting price
   - Emphasize differentiation in ad copy and landing pages
5. **Avoid:** Reflexive price matching that erodes margins without evidence of customer loss

### Playbook: Competitor Launches New Feature / Product

1. **Assess overlap** — Does this feature compete with your core offering or a peripheral area?
2. **Gauge demand** — Check search trends, social mentions, and customer feedback for the feature
3. **Timeline assessment** — How long to build a comparable feature? Is it even strategic for you?
4. **Response options:**
   - Fast follow (if the feature aligns with your roadmap and is high-demand)
   - Differentiate (double down on your strengths and highlight in messaging)
   - Partner (integrate a third-party solution rather than building)
   - Ignore (if the feature is niche and your data shows low customer demand)
5. **Update sales enablement** — Provide talking points for sales/CS on how to position against the new feature

### Playbook: Competitor Increases Ad Spend Significantly

1. **Verify** — Use SpyFu, Pathmatics, or Meta Ad Library to confirm the increase
2. **Measure impact** — Track your impression share, CPCs, and auction competition metrics
3. **Assess duration** — Is this a campaign burst or a sustained increase?
4. **Response options:**
   - Hold position on high-ROI campaigns; reduce spend on marginal campaigns
   - Shift budget to channels where the competitor is not present
   - Improve ad quality (creative, landing page) to maintain position at lower cost
   - Increase spend only in segments where you have a clear efficiency advantage
5. **Do not** engage in a bidding war on broad terms with poor ROAS

### Playbook: New Competitor Enters Market

1. **Profile immediately** — Funding, team, positioning, pricing, initial channels
2. **Classify tier** — Usually Tier 4 initially; upgrade if traction is evident
3. **Monitor traction signals** — Traffic growth, social following, review volume, hiring
4. **Response options:**
   - Strengthen your incumbent advantages (reviews, content, SEO moat, customer relationships)
   - Consider defensive content targeting their brand name comparisons
   - Accelerate feature/product development that widens your differentiation
5. **Brief the team** — Update sales and CS so they can address the new competitor in conversations
