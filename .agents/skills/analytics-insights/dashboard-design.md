# Marketing Dashboard Design — Architecture & Best Practices

> **Benchmark provenance (as of 2026-08):** Dollar figures in this document are planning priors, not quotes — market and auction rates drift continuously. Before any figure enters a media plan, budget, or client deliverable, refresh it live (platform dashboards and current published reports beat memory) and record it with `python scripts/benchmark_book.py --action record ... --source <url>`; quote from the book thereafter (`--action quote`). Never present an unstamped figure as current market fact.

## Dashboard Hierarchy

Marketing dashboards should exist in three tiers, each serving a different audience, cadence, and depth of detail.

```
Executive Dashboard (C-Suite, VP)
├── 5-7 KPIs | Monthly review | Strategic decisions
│
Operational Dashboard (Directors, Managers)
├── 15-20 metrics | Weekly review | Tactical adjustments
│
Campaign Dashboard (Specialists, Analysts)
└── 30+ metrics | Daily/real-time | Execution optimization
```

| Tier | Audience | KPI Count | Review Cadence | Time Range | Update Frequency |
|------|----------|-----------|----------------|------------|-----------------|
| Executive | C-suite, VP, Board | 5-7 | Monthly | MoM, QoQ, YoY | Weekly refresh |
| Operational | Directors, Managers | 15-20 | Weekly | WoW, MoM | Daily refresh |
| Campaign | Specialists, Analysts | 30+ | Daily | Daily, hourly | Real-time or hourly |

## Executive Dashboard Template

### Purpose
Give leadership a single-screen view of marketing's impact on business outcomes. No scrolling. No tabs. Every metric has context (vs. target, vs. prior period).

### Required Metrics (5-7 maximum)

| Metric | Visualization | Context Needed |
|--------|--------------|----------------|
| Marketing-sourced revenue | Scorecard with sparkline | vs. target, vs. same month last year |
| Blended CAC | Scorecard with trend arrow | vs. target, MoM change |
| Marketing-influenced pipeline | Scorecard with sparkline | vs. target, vs. prior month |
| Blended ROAS or ROI | Scorecard with trend arrow | vs. target, channel breakdown in tooltip |
| Total qualified leads (MQL/SQL/PQL) | Bar chart (monthly, 6-month trend) | vs. target line overlay |
| Channel mix (% revenue by channel) | Stacked bar or donut | MoM shift highlighted |
| Funnel conversion rate | Horizontal funnel chart | vs. benchmark, vs. prior period |

### Executive Dashboard Rules

- [ ] Every metric shows comparison context (vs. target, vs. prior period, vs. same period last year)
- [ ] Color coding: green = on track, yellow = within 10% of target, red = more than 10% off target
- [ ] No more than 7 metrics on the primary view
- [ ] Trend direction arrows on every scorecard
- [ ] Date range selector defaults to current month with prior month comparison
- [ ] No jargon — use business language, not platform-specific terms

## Visualization Best Practices

### Chart Type Selection Guide

| Data Type | Best Visualization | When to Use | Avoid |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|-------|
| Single KPI (current value) | Scorecard / Big number | Executive summary, key metrics | Using a chart for a single number |
| Trend over time (1 metric) | Line chart with sparkline | Traffic, conversion rate, revenue trends | Pie chart for time-series data |
| Trend over time (multiple) | Multi-line or stacked area | Channel comparison over time | More than 5 lines on one chart |
| Comparison (categories) | Horizontal bar chart | Channel performance, campaign comparison | 3D charts, vertical bars with long labels |
| Part of whole | Donut chart or stacked bar | Budget allocation, traffic mix | Pie chart with more than 6 slices |
| Distribution | Histogram | Quality Score distribution, CPC ranges | Line chart for non-continuous data |
| Funnel / flow | Funnel chart or Sankey | Conversion funnel stages | Bar chart for sequential flow data |
| Performance vs target | Bullet chart or gauge | KPI vs target tracking | Complicated gauge with multiple needles |
| Two metrics correlation | Scatter plot | CPC vs conversion rate, spend vs revenue | Without clear axis labels and context |
| Time-of-day/day-of-week | Heatmap | Engagement patterns, conversion timing | Line chart with 168 hourly data points |
| Geographic | Choropleth map | Regional performance | Maps for non-geographic data |
| Comparison of many items | Table with conditional formatting | Keyword reports, ad comparisons | Overly complex charts |

### Design Principles

- [ ] Use consistent color palettes across all dashboards (assign one color per channel permanently)
- [ ] Left-to-right reading order: most important metrics on the top-left
- [ ] White space between sections — do not cram metrics together
- [ ] Every chart has a title that states the insight, not just the metric name ("Revenue is trending 12% above target" not "Revenue")
- [ ] Include the date range and last refresh time on every dashboard page
- [ ] Use consistent number formatting (currency, percentages, abbreviations)
- [ ] Add annotations for known events (campaign launch, site outage, holiday, algorithm update)
- [ ] Sparklines for compact trend visualization on scorecards
- [ ] Conditional formatting: red/yellow/green tied to specific thresholds, not arbitrary ranges

## Alert Threshold Configuration

### Critical Alerts (Immediate Notification)

| Condition | Threshold | Action |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Website traffic drop | >30% vs. 7-day average (hourly check) | Check for site issues, tracking breaks, algorithm changes |
| Conversion rate collapse | >40% drop vs. 7-day average | Check landing pages, checkout, forms, tracking |
| Ad spend spike | >150% of daily budget | Check for automated bid runaway, budget caps |
| Revenue drop | >25% vs. same day last week | Cross-reference traffic, CVR, AOV to diagnose |
| Campaign disapprovals | Any ad or keyword disapproved | Review disapproval reason, fix, resubmit |

### Warning Alerts (Next Business Day)

| Condition | Threshold | Action |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Traffic decline | >20% vs. 7-day average (daily check) | Investigate by channel |
| Conversion rate drop | >15% vs. 30-day average | A/B test check, landing page audit |
| CPA increase | >20% above target for 3+ consecutive days | Bid adjustments, audience review |
| Email bounce rate | >5% on any send | List hygiene, domain reputation check |
| Bounce rate spike | >10 point increase over baseline | Content relevance, page speed, mobile UX |
| Ad budget under-spend | <70% of daily budget by end of day | Check bid competitiveness, targeting restrictions |

### Informational Alerts (Weekly Review)

| Condition | Threshold | Action |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Keyword quality score drop | Any keyword drops 2+ points | Review ad relevance and landing page |
| New high-traffic referrer | Referral source sends 100+ sessions/week | Investigate source, consider partnership |
| Audience fatigue | Frequency >10 per user per week | Refresh creative, expand audience |
| Organic ranking change | Any top-10 keyword drops out of page 1 | Content refresh, technical audit |

## Data Freshness Trade-offs

| Freshness Level | Update Frequency | Typical Use | Trade-off |
|----------------|-----------------|-------------|-----------|
| Real-time | Continuous/seconds | Campaign dashboards, spend monitoring | Higher API costs, more complex infrastructure |
| Near-real-time | Every 15-60 minutes | Operational dashboards, budget pacing | Moderate complexity, most actionable |
| Daily | Once per day (overnight) | Operational and executive dashboards | Simple to build, sufficient for most decisions |
| Weekly aggregate | Weekly rollup | Executive dashboards, trend analysis | Smooths noise, misses daily anomalies |
| Monthly aggregate | Monthly rollup | Board reports, strategic reviews | Long-term trends only, no tactical value |

### Recommended Freshness by Dashboard

- **Executive:** Daily refresh is sufficient (decisions are monthly/quarterly)
- **Operational:** Daily refresh minimum, hourly for paid advertising metrics
- **Campaign:** Real-time for spend and impressions, hourly for conversions and CPA

## Dashboard Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Fix |
|-------------|-------------|-----|
| Vanity metrics only | Impressions and followers without business outcomes mislead leadership | Always tie to revenue, pipeline, or conversion |
| Too many metrics | 50+ metrics on one screen causes analysis paralysis | Enforce the tier system — 7 max for executive |
| No comparison context | A number without context is meaningless ("1,234 conversions" — is that good?) | Always show vs. target, vs. prior period, vs. benchmark |
| Missing date range | Metrics without clear time period are uninterpretable | Display date range prominently on every page |
| Stale data without notice | Dashboard shows data from 3 days ago without indicating it | Show "Last updated: [timestamp]" prominently |
| Inconsistent definitions | "Conversion" means different things on different charts | Include metric definitions in a glossary tab |
| No drill-down path | Executive sees a red metric but can't investigate further | Link executive → operational → campaign dashboards |
| Chart overload | Every metric in a complex chart when a table would be clearer | Use the simplest effective visualization |
| No annotations | Sudden metric changes with no context on what happened | Add event markers (launches, outages, holidays, updates) |
| Platform-specific jargon | Using "CPM" and "ROAS" with a non-marketing executive audience | Translate to business language for executive dashboards |

*A dashboard that nobody checks is worse than no dashboard at all. Design for your audience's decisions, not your analyst's curiosity. Every metric on screen should answer a question someone actually asks, and every answer should suggest an action they can actually take.*
