# KPI Frameworks — Business-Model-Specific Metric Trees

## KPI Tree Methodology

A KPI tree is a hierarchical decomposition of business outcomes into measurable, actionable metrics. Every metric in the tree should trace back to a single North Star and forward to a specific team or lever.

### Hierarchy Levels

| Level | Purpose | Owner | Review Cadence |
|-------|---------|-------|----------------|
| **North Star** | Single metric representing core value delivery | CEO / Founder | Weekly |
| **Primary Metrics** | 3-5 metrics that directly drive the North Star | VP / Director | Weekly |
| **Supporting Metrics** | Channel or function-specific drivers of Primary metrics | Manager / Lead | Weekly |
| **Diagnostic Metrics** | Granular inputs investigated when Supporting metrics move | Analyst / Specialist | As needed |

### Building a KPI Tree — Step by Step

1. **Define the North Star** — What single metric, if maximized, would guarantee long-term business health?
2. **Decompose mathematically** — Break the North Star into a formula (e.g., Revenue = Customers x AOV x Frequency)
3. **Assign primary metrics** — Each variable in the formula becomes a primary metric
4. **Layer supporting metrics** — For each primary metric, identify the 2-4 inputs that drive it
5. **Add diagnostics** — For each supporting metric, list the granular signals you would check if it moved unexpectedly
6. **Assign owners** — Every metric gets one owner, never shared
7. **Set targets** — Use historical baselines + industry benchmarks + growth goals

## North Star Metric Selection Guide

Your North Star must satisfy all five criteria:

- [ ] **Value-aligned** — It reflects genuine value delivered to customers
- [ ] **Leading** — It predicts long-term revenue, not just measures past revenue
- [ ] **Actionable** — Teams can influence it through their daily work
- [ ] **Measurable** — It can be tracked accurately with existing infrastructure
- [ ] **Simple** — Anyone in the company can understand and recite it

| Business Model | Recommended North Star | Why |
|----------------|----------------------|-----|
| B2B SaaS | Weekly Active Users (qualified) — product-led usage North Star; NRR is the revenue North Star | Predicts retention and expansion better than revenue |
| eCommerce | Revenue per Visitor (RPV) | Combines traffic quality, conversion, and AOV |
| Marketplace | Transactions completed per week | Captures both supply and demand health |
| Local Business | Repeat visit rate (monthly) | Loyalty drives sustainable local economics |
| DTC Brand | 90-day repeat purchase rate | LTV-driven models live or die on repeat behavior |
| Media / Content | Engaged time per user per week | Attention is the product; engagement predicts monetization |
