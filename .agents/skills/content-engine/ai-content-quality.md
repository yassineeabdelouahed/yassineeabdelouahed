## Common AI Content Pitfalls

| Pitfall | How to Spot It | How to Fix It |
|---------|---------------|--------------|
| **Generic language** | Phrases like "in today's fast-paced world" | Replace with specific, concrete statements |
| **Hallucinated facts** | Statistics without verifiable sources | Fact-check every number and claim |
| **Lack of POV** | Content reads as neutral summary | Add expert opinion, take a position |
| **Repetitive structure** | Every section follows same pattern | Vary formats (list, narrative, table, example) |
| **Over-hedging** | "May," "might," "could potentially" everywhere | Make definitive statements where supported |
| **Missing specificity** | "Many companies" instead of "67% of B2B firms" | Replace vague claims with data |
| **Filler paragraphs** | Sections that don't add new information | Delete or replace with substantive content |
| **Inconsistent depth** | Some sections detailed, others superficial | Balance depth across all sections |

## Human Review Workflow

### AI Handles (Draft Phase)
- Initial research and outline
- First draft of body content
- Generating content variations (headlines, CTAs)
- Formatting and structure
- SEO optimization (keyword placement, meta descriptions)

### Human Reviews (Edit Phase)
- Factual accuracy verification
- Brand voice alignment
- Unique insight and perspective injection
- Tone and sensitivity review (cultural, legal, brand safety)
- Final approval for publication

### Review Roles
| Role | Responsibility | Time Required |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| **Subject matter expert** | Verify accuracy, add expertise | 15-30 min per piece |
| **Brand voice reviewer** | Check voice consistency, tone | 10-15 min per piece |
| **Editor** | Readability, structure, flow | 20-30 min per piece |
| **Compliance reviewer** | Legal claims, disclosures, regulations | 10-20 min (if applicable) |

## AI Content Disclosure

### When to Disclose
- **Required**: When regulations mandate disclosure (evolving — check jurisdiction)
- **Required (EU)**: EU AI Act Article 50 applies from 2 Aug 2026 — AI-generated content targeting EU audiences needs machine-readable + visible disclosure. The `eu_disclosure_if_ai` gate enforces this at publish time; use `/digital-marketing-pro:c2pa-metadata` to embed the machine-readable provenance manifest
- **Recommended**: When content is substantially AI-generated
- **Not needed**: When AI is used as a writing tool but human significantly edits

### Disclosure Language Options
- "This article was written with AI assistance and reviewed by [Expert Name]"
- "Research and initial drafting assisted by AI. Verified and edited by our editorial team"
- Keep disclosure simple, honest, and non-defensive
