## 1. Competitor Identification and Categorization

### Category Definitions

| Category | Definition | Examples | Monitoring Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Direct** | Same product/service, same target market. Competes for the same customers and keywords. | Two SaaS project management tools targeting mid-market | Highest — monitor daily to weekly |
| **Indirect** | Different product, solves the same underlying need. Customers choose between you. | Project management tool vs. spreadsheet-based workflow | Medium — monitor weekly to monthly |
| **Aspirational** | Where you want to be. Market leaders or category-defining brands you benchmark against. | A startup benchmarking against Salesforce or HubSpot | Low — monitor monthly to quarterly |
| **Emerging** | Startups, new entrants, or adjacent players expanding into your market. | A CRM adding project management features | Medium-high — monitor weekly (early detection is critical) |

### Competitor Profiling Template

For each tracked competitor, maintain a structured profile:

- **Company**: Name, URL, founding year, funding stage/revenue estimate, employee count
- **Product**: Core features, pricing tiers, free tier availability, key differentiators
- **Market**: Target segments, geographic focus, vertical specializations
- **Digital presence**: Domain authority, estimated organic traffic, top ranking keywords (count), social following by platform, ad spend estimates
- **Content strategy**: Blog cadence, content types (blog, video, podcast, webinar), gated vs. ungated ratio
- **Messaging**: Tagline, primary value proposition, positioning statement, key claims
- **Last updated**: Timestamp of most recent profile refresh

## 2. Monitoring Cadence by Category

### Daily Monitoring (Automated)

- **Pricing changes**: Scrape pricing pages. Compare to stored snapshot. Alert on any change to tier names, prices, feature inclusions, or plan structure
- **Stock/availability changes**: For eCommerce competitors, monitor product availability status changes
- **Critical keyword movements**: Track positions for top 10-20 head terms. Alert on competitor entering top 3 or displacing your position
- **Ad creative changes**: Monitor Google Ads Transparency Center and Meta Ad Library for new creatives from tracked competitors
- **Press/news mentions**: News API or Google Alerts for competitor brand mentions in news sources

### Weekly Monitoring

- **Content publishing**: Check competitor blog RSS feeds or scrape blog index pages. Log new posts with title, URL, topic, word count estimate, target keyword
- **Social media activity**: Pull posting frequency, engagement rates, follower growth. Flag anomalies (posting frequency change >50%, engagement spike >3x average)
- **Backlink acquisition**: Check new referring domains to competitor sites via backlink monitoring APIs. Flag high-authority links (DA 60+)
- **Ad messaging themes**: Review active ads across platforms. Categorize by offer type (discount, free trial, feature highlight, social proof)
- **SERP feature changes**: Track which competitors appear in Featured Snippets, AI Overviews, PAA, Knowledge Panels for target keywords

### Monthly Monitoring

- **Strategy shifts**: Review competitor blog topics, ad messaging, product updates, and hiring patterns for strategic direction signals
- **Positioning changes**: Compare current messaging to previous month. Flag tagline changes, new claims, repositioning language
- **Share of voice recalculation**: Full SOV analysis across organic, paid, and social channels
- **Technology stack changes**: Monitor via BuiltWith or similar for CMS, analytics, marketing automation, CRM platform changes
- **Review/sentiment trends**: Aggregate G2, Capterra, Trustpilot ratings. Track sentiment trajectory

### Quarterly Monitoring

- **Full competitive audit**: Complete refresh of all competitor profiles. Update market positioning map
- **Win/loss analysis**: Review CRM win/loss data for the quarter. Identify competitor-specific patterns
- **Content gap analysis**: Compare your content coverage to top 3 competitors. Identify topics they cover that you do not
- **Feature comparison matrix update**: Refresh product feature comparison. Note new features, deprecated features, pricing changes

## 3. Change Detection Methodology

### HTML Diffing for Content Changes

- **Page content hashing**: Generate SHA-256 hash of main content area (exclude navigation, footer, ads). Compare to stored hash. Hash change = content change
- **Selective element monitoring**: Track specific CSS selectors per competitor page:
  - Pricing page: `.pricing-table`, `.plan-card`, `.price-amount`
  - Homepage: `.hero-section`, `.value-prop`, `.social-proof`
  - Product page: `.feature-list`, `.integration-list`, `.changelog`
- **Diff generation**: When hash changes, generate line-by-line diff. Classify change as: minor (typo, formatting), moderate (copy update, new section), major (restructure, new page, pricing change)
- **Screenshot comparison**: Capture viewport screenshots before and after change detection. Visual diff highlights layout/design changes that text diffing misses

### Meta Tag Monitoring

Track per competitor page per check:

| Element | Detection | Significance |
|---|---|---|
| `<title>` tag | Exact string comparison | Keyword targeting change, brand positioning shift |
| `<meta name="description">` | Exact string comparison | Messaging or CTA change |
| `<meta name="robots">` | Exact string comparison | Indexing strategy change (noindex = page being removed) |
| Canonical URL | Exact string comparison | URL structure change, consolidation signal |
| Schema markup types | Parse JSON-LD, compare `@type` values | Rich result strategy change |
| OG tags | Compare `og:title`, `og:description`, `og:image` | Social messaging or creative change |
| Hreflang tags | Count and language codes | International expansion or contraction |

### Structural Change Detection

- **Navigation monitoring**: Parse main navigation links. Flag new menu items (new product, new feature page, new resource section)
- **Sitemap monitoring**: Download and parse `sitemap.xml`. Compare URL count and new URLs to previous snapshot. New URLs indicate new pages/sections
- **Page count tracking**: Track total indexed pages via `site:competitor.com` query count. Significant increases indicate content pushes; decreases indicate pruning

## 4. Share of Voice Calculation

### Organic Share of Voice

**Formula**: SOV = Sum of (estimated traffic per keyword) / Sum of (total estimated traffic for all tracked keywords across all competitors)

**Calculation steps**:
1. Define keyword universe: all target keywords relevant to the category (100-1,000 keywords)
2. Pull ranking positions for all competitors for each keyword
3. Apply CTR curve to estimate traffic per keyword per competitor:
   - Position 1: ~28% CTR, Position 2: ~15%, Position 3: ~11%, Position 4: ~8%, Position 5: ~7%
   - Position 6-10: ~2-5%, Position 11-20: ~0.5-2%, Position 21+: ~0%
4. Multiply estimated CTR by keyword search volume = estimated traffic
5. Sum per competitor, divide by total = SOV percentage

### Paid Share of Voice

- **Google Ads Auction Insights**: `impression_share` metric per campaign/keyword. Divide your impression share by sum of all competitors' impression shares for normalized SOV
- **Meta Ads**: Use reach and frequency estimates from Meta Ad Library. Calculate share based on estimated impressions in target audience
- **Spend-based SOV**: If spend data is available (via competitive intelligence tools), SOV = your spend / total category spend
- **SERP ad presence**: For target keywords, count how often each competitor's ad appears in top positions. Presence rate = ad SOV proxy

### Social Share of Voice

- **Volume-based**: Count of brand mentions (including hashtags, @mentions, organic discussion) / total category mentions. Source: social listening tool with Boolean queries
- **Engagement-weighted**: Weight mentions by engagement (likes, shares, comments). Higher-engagement mentions count more
- **Sentiment-adjusted**: Multiply mention volume by sentiment score (positive = 1.0, neutral = 0.5, negative = 0.0). Prevents brands with high negative buzz from showing inflated SOV

### Feature-Weighted SOV (Composite)

Combine channel SOVs with strategic weighting:

| Channel | Suggested Weight | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Organic search | 35% | High-intent traffic, long-term brand authority |
| Paid search | 20% | Direct conversion channel, reflects investment level |
| Social organic | 15% | Brand awareness and community engagement |
| Social paid | 15% | Targeted reach, campaign-driven visibility |
| AI engine visibility | 15% | Growing channel, represents future discovery patterns |

## 5. Competitive Response Playbooks

### Competitor Price Drop

1. **Detect**: Pricing page change detected. Calculate % reduction and affected tiers
2. **Assess**: Determine if price drop is permanent, promotional, or segment-specific. Check for accompanying messaging changes (new tagline, "most affordable" positioning)
3. **Decision tree**:
   - If competitor targets your strongest segment: **High urgency**. Prepare value-based counter-messaging within 48 hours. Do not match price unless margin analysis supports it
   - If competitor targets a segment you are weak in: **Low urgency**. Monitor for 2 weeks. Assess if their pricing attracts your existing customers
   - If promotional/temporary: **No immediate action**. Document promotion terms and duration. Prepare counter-promotion if deal velocity drops
4. **Response options**: Emphasize value/ROI over price, bundle features to increase perceived value, introduce a competitive migration offer (limited time), create comparison content highlighting total cost of ownership

### Competitor Product Launch

- **T+0 (Detection)**: Log launch details — feature name, positioning, pricing impact, target segment
- **T+24h (Analysis)**: Deep-dive on feature capabilities. Test if possible (free trial, demo). Assess overlap with your roadmap
- **T+48h (Messaging)**: Draft positioning response. Options: "we already do this" (if true), "here's why our approach is better," or "this validates the category we're building"
- **T+1 week (Content)**: Publish comparison content if strategically valuable. Update feature comparison pages. Brief sales team with competitive battle card
- **T+1 month (Assessment)**: Monitor adoption signals (social mentions, review site feedback, search volume for feature name). Determine if a product response is needed

### Competitor Content Push

- **Signal**: Competitor increases publishing frequency >2x or launches new content format (podcast, video series, newsletter)
- **Assessment**: Analyze content topics for keyword overlap with your strategy. Check if their new content is ranking for your target terms
- **Response**: Prioritize content creation for overlapping keywords where you have ranking potential. Accelerate planned content in affected topic clusters. Do not reactively create content on topics outside your strategy

## 6. Win/Loss Feedback Integration

### CRM Data Collection Points

- **Deal stage field**: `Competitor Mentioned` — multi-select field populated during discovery and negotiation stages
- **Win/loss reason**: Structured field with categories: Price, Features, Brand/Trust, Relationship, Timing, Integration, Support
- **Post-decision survey**: Sent within 48 hours of closed-won or closed-lost. 3-5 questions: primary alternative considered, decisive factor, perception of each vendor
- **Sales debrief notes**: Free-text field for qualitative context from the sales rep

### Analysis Patterns

- **Competitor frequency**: Which competitors appear most in deals? Trend over time (increasing = growing threat)
- **Win rate by competitor**: When competitor X is in the deal, what is your win rate? Segment by deal size, segment, and region
- **Loss reason by competitor**: When you lose to competitor X, why? Identifies specific weaknesses to address
- **Content influence**: Which content pieces were shared during deals you won vs. lost? Identifies effective competitive content
- **Segment vulnerability**: Are certain customer segments more likely to choose specific competitors? Guides targeting and positioning

## 7. Alert Management and Escalation

### Escalation Tiers

| Tier | Trigger | Response Time | Notification Channel | Recipient |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **P1 — Critical** | Pricing change, product launch, acquisition, executive departure, major rebrand | < 4 hours | Slack DM + email | Marketing lead, product lead, sales lead |
| **P2 — Important** | Messaging change, new ad campaign, significant content push, new partnership | < 24 hours | Slack channel | Marketing team |
| **P3 — Informational** | Minor content updates, social activity changes, small feature updates | Weekly digest | Email digest | Subscribed stakeholders |

### Alert Fatigue Prevention

- **Deduplication**: Group related changes into a single alert (e.g., 5 new blog posts = 1 "content push" alert, not 5 separate alerts)
- **Threshold tuning**: Start with sensitive thresholds, then widen based on false positive rate. Target: <20% false positive rate
- **Digest mode**: P3 alerts always delivered as weekly digest. Never real-time for informational changes
- **Snooze capability**: Allow recipients to snooze specific competitors or change types for defined periods
- **Channel routing**: Different alert types to different channels. Sales gets pricing/product alerts. Content team gets content/SEO alerts. Leadership gets P1 only

### Competitive Intelligence Database Schema

```
