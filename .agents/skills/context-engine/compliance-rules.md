## Section 1: Geographic Privacy Laws

### 1.1 EU/EEA — General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Region** | European Union / European Economic Area (27 EU member states + Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway) |
| **Law** | General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) |
| **Year Enacted** | 2016 (enforced May 25, 2018) |
| **Consent Model** | Opt-in. Explicit, informed, freely given, specific, and unambiguous consent required before processing personal data. Consent must be as easy to withdraw as to give. Legitimate interest may apply in narrow B2B contexts but requires a documented balancing test. |
| **Email Rules** | Prior opt-in required for all marketing emails. Soft opt-in exception: existing customers may be emailed about similar products/services if given an easy opt-out at collection and in every message. Every email must include sender identity, physical address, and a functional unsubscribe mechanism honored within 30 days. |
| **Cookie/Tracking Rules** | Prior consent required for all non-essential cookies and trackers (ePrivacy Directive). Cookie banners must allow granular choice (accept/reject by category). Pre-ticked boxes are invalid. Analytics cookies require consent unless strictly necessary. Server-side tracking of personal data still requires a lawful basis. |
| **Penalty Range** | Up to EUR 20 million or 4% of global annual turnover, whichever is higher. Supervisory authorities may also issue warnings, bans on processing, and orders to erase data. |
| **Key Marketing Impact** | Double opt-in is industry standard. All lead forms need clear consent checkboxes (not bundled). Data Processing Agreements required with every martech vendor. Privacy policy must disclose all data recipients. Cross-border data transfers require adequacy decisions, SCCs, or BCRs. Right to erasure means suppression lists must be maintained. Profiling for ad targeting requires explicit consent or legitimate interest with opt-out. |

### 1.1b EU/EEA — AI Act Article 50 (Generative AI Disclosure)

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Region** | European Union / European Economic Area |
| **Law** | Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 — Artificial Intelligence Act, Article 50 (Transparency obligations for providers and deployers of certain AI systems) |
| **Applicable** | **2 August 2026** (transparency obligations); general-purpose AI obligations applied 2 Aug 2025; high-risk system obligations 2 Aug 2027 |
| **Scope** | All generative-AI outputs distributed in EU markets — no minimum spend threshold, advertising not exempted. Both providers (AI developers) and deployers (advertisers, brands) bear obligations. |
| **Disclosure Requirements** | (a) AI-generated or AI-manipulated content **must be marked in a machine-readable format** using open, interoperable standards. **C2PA (Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity) is the emerging backbone.** Marking must be technically robust and survive routine processing. (b) Deepfakes (synthetic audio/image/video resembling real persons, objects, places, or events) must be **visibly disclosed**. (c) AI-generated text on matters of public interest must be disclosed unless human-reviewed and the brand assumes editorial responsibility. |
| **Carve-outs** | Genuine artistic, satirical, or fictional works are narrowly exempt — applies in limited cases and does not blanket-exempt marketing. |
| **Penalty Range** | Up to **EUR 15 million or 3% of global annual turnover**, whichever is higher (transparency obligations). High-risk system breaches up to EUR 35M or 7%. |
| **Key Marketing Impact** | Any AI-generated ad creative, social image, AI-narrated video, or AI-written long-form copy distributed in the EU must carry machine-readable provenance metadata. Use `/digital-marketing-pro:c2pa-metadata` to embed a C2PA manifest in any AI-generated image / video / audio / PDF before EU publication. Deepfakes need an additional visible disclosure overlay or audio cue. AI-written editorial pieces need an "AI-assisted" byline unless the human editor assumes full editorial accountability. The pre-publish gate (`/digital-marketing-pro:check`) verifies C2PA presence on AI-flagged assets in EU-targeted campaigns. |

#### 1.1b.i — Article 50 implementing guidelines (FINAL, 2026)

The European Commission published draft implementing guidelines for Article 50 on 8 May 2026 (consultation closed 3 June) and has since **adopted the final Guidelines**, alongside the AI Office's **final Code of Practice on Transparency of AI-Generated Content (10 June 2026)** — both ahead of the 2 August 2026 applicability date. The clarifications below carried through from the draft into the final interpretation:

| Topic | Final guidance (2026) | What this means for marketing |
|---|---|---|
| **"Substantial AI manipulation"** | Defined as any AI-driven change that alters meaning, identity, or factual claims of a real person, object, place, or event. Routine colour correction, framing, denoising are NOT in scope. | A subject-replacement image swap = substantial manipulation (disclosure). A Lightroom-style retouch = not. |
| **"Matters of public interest"** | Includes health, elections, finance, government services, public safety, and any topic where a reasonable consumer expects journalistic accuracy. Marketing copy itself is generally not in scope UNLESS it crosses into one of those topics (e.g., health claims, financial product claims). | Generic product copy = no AI disclosure required. AI-generated copy making health, financial, or political claims = disclosure required unless a human editor signs off. |
| **Machine-readable marking** | C2PA Content Credentials are explicitly named as a "presumption of compliance" pathway. Alternative open-standard markings allowed if technically equivalent. | Continue using C2PA via `/digital-marketing-pro:c2pa-metadata`. Brands that ship without C2PA must show equivalent provenance — substantially more work. |
| **Deepfake visible disclosure** | Visible label, watermark, or audio cue must be perceivable at normal viewing/listening distance. Hidden corner overlays in a tiny font are explicitly insufficient. | If you produce a synthetic-talent ad or AI-cloned voice ad for the EU market, the disclosure must be visible from any normal viewing distance. |
| **Editorial-responsibility carve-out** | Human reviewer must (a) be identifiable, (b) have authority to alter or reject the AI output, (c) have a documented review record. A pure rubber-stamp does not satisfy the carve-out. | A documented reviewer scorecard (e.g. the quality-assurance agent's logged eval) satisfies (c), but a named human editor must still sign off and that name must be on the published piece (byline, masthead, or accessible "About this article" link). |
| **Enforcement priority** | National regulators are expected to prioritise (1) deepfakes, (2) AI-generated political/health content, (3) AI-generated content marketed without any provenance metadata at all. Routine commercial creative with C2PA is low priority. | Brands using C2PA across EU-distributed AI assets are in a strong defensive posture under the final guidelines. |

**Action items for brands with EU exposure before 2 August 2026:**

1. **Audit your EU AI-asset inventory now.** Catalogue any AI-generated image, video, audio, deepfake-style synthetic content, and AI-written long-form copy distributed to EU users in the last 12 months. Identify which carry C2PA and which don't.
2. **Lock in your C2PA signing-cert procurement immediately — Article 50 applies 2 August 2026.** See `docs/c2pa-production-cert-guide.md` for the four recognised authorities. Allow 2–4 weeks for Adobe Content Credentials approval.
3. **Update your Definition of Done.** Any creative produced for EU distribution should be C2PA-signed at production time, not retrofitted at publish time. The pre-publish gate (`/digital-marketing-pro:check`) blocks unsigned AI assets for EU-targeted campaigns.
4. **Treat the carve-out as conditional, not a free pass.** "Human-reviewed" requires named accountability. Don't claim editorial responsibility unless a named editor is willing to be on the record.

### 1.2 United States Federal — CAN-SPAM Act

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Region** | United States (federal) |
| **Law** | Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act (CAN-SPAM) |
| **Year Enacted** | 2003 (effective January 1, 2004; amended 2008) |
| **Consent Model** | Opt-out. No prior consent required to send commercial email. Recipients must be given a clear way to opt out, and opt-out requests must be honored within 10 business days. |
| **Email Rules** | No deceptive subject lines. "From" and "Reply-To" must accurately identify the sender. Every commercial email must include: a clear identification as an advertisement (if applicable), the sender's valid physical postal address, and a conspicuous opt-out mechanism. Purchased lists are legal but opt-out obligations still apply. Transactional emails are exempt if their primary purpose is transactional. |
| **Cookie/Tracking Rules** | No federal cookie consent law. Tracking pixels in email are legal. The FTC enforces against deceptive tracking practices under Section 5 of the FTC Act. |
| **Penalty Range** | Civil penalties per violation (per email), inflation-adjusted annually (~$53K+ as of 2026). ISPs and state attorneys general may also bring actions. |
| **Key Marketing Impact** | Lower bar than GDPR but strict on opt-out honoring. Affiliate and partner emails count — the brand whose product is promoted is liable. "Sender" definition includes the entity whose product is advertised. Suppression list management is critical. Header manipulation is a criminal offense. |

### 1.3 California — CCPA / CPRA

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Region** | California, United States |
| **Law** | California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA, 2018) as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA, 2020; fully operative January 1, 2023) |
| **Year Enacted** | CCPA: 2018. CPRA amendment: 2020 (enforced 2023). |
| **Consent Model** | Opt-out for sale/sharing of personal information. Opt-in required for consumers under 16 (under 13 requires parental consent). "Sharing" includes cross-context behavioral advertising. |
| **Email Rules** | CAN-SPAM governs email. CCPA/CPRA layer on top: consumers can opt out of the "sale" or "sharing" of personal information used for email targeting and personalization. Honoring Global Privacy Control (GPC) signals is required. |
| **Cookie/Tracking Rules** | Third-party cookies and ad pixels that share data with ad platforms constitute "sharing" under CPRA. A "Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information" link must be on the website. GPC browser signals must be honored as a valid opt-out. |
| **Penalty Range** | $2,500 per unintentional violation; $7,500 per intentional violation. Private right of action for data breaches ($100–$750 per consumer per incident). Enforced by the California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA). |
| **Key Marketing Impact** | Retargeting audiences using third-party data requires opt-out mechanism. Service provider agreements needed with all martech vendors. 12-month lookback on data collection disclosures. "Sensitive personal information" (e.g., geolocation, race, health) triggers additional restrictions — limit use to what is necessary. |

### 1.4 US State Privacy Laws (Multi-State Summary)

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Region** | United States — 20+ states with enacted comprehensive privacy laws |
| **Laws** | Virginia (VCDPA, 2023), Colorado (CPA, 2023), Connecticut (CTDPA, 2023), Utah (UCPA, 2023), Iowa (ICDPA, 2025), Indiana (ICDPA, 2026), Tennessee (TIPA, 2025), Montana (MCDPA, 2024), Texas (TDPSA, 2024), Oregon (OCPA, 2024), Delaware (DPDPA, 2025), New Hampshire (SB 255, 2025), New Jersey (SB 332, 2025), Nebraska (NDPA, 2025), Maryland (MODPA, 2025), Minnesota (MCDPA, 2025), Rhode Island (RIDPA, 2026), Kentucky (KCDPA, 2026), Vermont (VDPA, 2025), and others pending. |
| **Year Enacted** | Rolling: 2021–2026. Most operative between 2023–2026. |
| **Consent Model** | Generally opt-out for sale of data and targeted advertising. Opt-in for sensitive data processing. Most follow the VCDPA template. Maryland and Minnesota are more restrictive (closer to GDPR's data minimization standard). |
| **Email Rules** | Defer to CAN-SPAM federally. State laws add data rights (access, deletion, correction, portability) that affect CRM and email list management. |
| **Cookie/Tracking Rules** | Most require opt-out rights for targeted advertising (which implicates ad cookies and pixels). Universal opt-out mechanisms (like GPC) are mandated in Colorado, Connecticut, Texas, Montana, Oregon, Delaware, and others. |
| **Penalty Range** | Typically $7,500–$10,000 per violation. Most enforced by the state Attorney General. Few have private rights of action. Cure periods (30–60 days) are common in early-enacted laws but are being removed in newer laws. |
| **Key Marketing Impact** | Treat the US as a patchwork. The safest approach is to build to the most restrictive standard (currently Maryland or CPRA) and apply nationally. Universal opt-out signal support is becoming table stakes. Data mapping is essential to know which state laws apply to which consumers. |

### 1.5 Canada — CASL

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Region** | Canada |
| **Law** | Canada's Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL) |
| **Year Enacted** | 2014 |
| **Consent Model** | Opt-in. Express consent required for commercial electronic messages (CEMs). Implied consent exists in limited cases: existing business relationship (within 2 years of purchase, 6 months of inquiry), conspicuous publication of address (if relevant to role), or disclosure via referral. |
| **Email Rules** | Every CEM must include: sender identification, contact information (physical and digital), and a functional unsubscribe mechanism processed within 10 business days. Consent records must be retained with proof of how and when consent was obtained. Consent requests themselves cannot contain marketing. |
| **Cookie/Tracking Rules** | CASL requires consent for installation of programs on devices. Cookie consent is governed by PIPEDA (federal privacy law) — implied consent may suffice for functional/analytics cookies, but tracking for ad targeting should use express consent. |
| **Penalty Range** | Up to CAD $10 million per violation (individuals: $1 million). CRTC enforces. Private right of action was enacted but enforcement is through administrative monetary penalties. |
| **Key Marketing Impact** | One of the strictest email laws globally. Implied consent windows are short — CRM must track consent expiry. "Conspicuous publication" is narrow and does not cover scraping. B2B cold outreach is heavily restricted. Referral/tell-a-friend programs require careful structuring. |

### 1.6 Brazil — LGPD

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Region** | Brazil |
| **Law** | Lei Geral de Protecao de Dados (LGPD) |
| **Year Enacted** | 2018 (enforced September 2020; penalties from August 2021) |
| **Consent Model** | Opt-in. Consent must be free, informed, and unambiguous for a specific purpose. Legitimate interest is available as an alternative basis but requires a Legitimate Interest Assessment (LIA). |
| **Email Rules** | Consent or legitimate interest required. Unsubscribe must be easy and immediate. Data subjects have rights to access, correction, deletion, and portability. Marketing communications must identify the sender and purpose. |
| **Cookie/Tracking Rules** | ANPD (National Data Protection Authority) guidance requires consent for non-essential cookies. Cookie banners with accept/reject options are standard practice. |
| **Penalty Range** | Up to 2% of revenue in Brazil, capped at BRL 50 million (~USD 10 million) per violation. ANPD may also issue warnings, publicize violations, and block or delete data. |
| **Key Marketing Impact** | Similar structure to GDPR but with a revenue cap specific to Brazilian operations. Data Protection Officer (DPO) appointment is mandatory. Cross-border transfers require adequacy, contractual safeguards, or consent. Portuguese-language privacy notices required. |

### 1.7 United Kingdom — UK GDPR + PECR

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Region** | United Kingdom |
| **Law** | UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) + Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR) |
| **Year Enacted** | UK GDPR: 2018 (retained post-Brexit, 2021). PECR: 2003. |
| **Consent Model** | Opt-in for marketing. PECR requires prior consent for unsolicited marketing emails to individuals. Soft opt-in exception (similar to EU): existing customers can be emailed about similar products if opt-out was offered at collection and in each message. B2B exception: corporate email addresses (e.g., info@company.com) may be contacted without prior consent under PECR, but UK GDPR still requires a lawful basis. |
| **Email Rules** | Same structural requirements as GDPR: sender identity, physical address, unsubscribe. ICO enforces. Unsolicited B2C email without consent is a PECR violation. |
| **Cookie/Tracking Rules** | PECR requires prior consent for non-essential cookies. ICO has signaled stricter enforcement. Legitimate interest is not a valid basis for ad cookies under PECR. |
| **Penalty Range** | UK GDPR: up to GBP 17.5 million or 4% of global turnover. PECR: up to GBP 500,000. ICO enforcement. |
| **Key Marketing Impact** | Post-Brexit, UK adequacy decision from the EU allows data flows, but this is subject to review. Data Protection Impact Assessments required for high-risk processing (profiling, large-scale marketing). ICO publishes direct marketing guidance — treat as binding. International transfers require UK-specific transfer mechanisms (UK SCCs, IDTA). |

### 1.8 Australia — Privacy Act + Spam Act

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Region** | Australia |
| **Law** | Privacy Act 1988 (Australian Privacy Principles) + Spam Act 2003 |
| **Year Enacted** | Privacy Act: 1988 (APPs added 2014). Spam Act: 2003. |
| **Consent Model** | Opt-in under the Spam Act for commercial electronic messages. Consent can be express or inferred (from an existing business relationship or conspicuous publication). The Privacy Act uses a "reasonable expectation" standard for use of personal information. |
| **Email Rules** | Spam Act requires: consent (express or inferred), accurate sender identification, functional unsubscribe honored within 5 business days. Address harvesting and list selling are prohibited. |
| **Cookie/Tracking Rules** | No specific cookie consent law currently. The Privacy Act requires transparency about data collection. The government's Privacy Act Review (2023–2025) is expected to introduce stronger consent requirements for tracking — monitor for changes. |
| **Penalty Range** | Spam Act: up to AUD 2.22 million per day for body corporates. Privacy Act: up to AUD 50 million, 3x the benefit obtained, or 30% of adjusted turnover (whichever is greater) following 2022 amendments. ACMA and OAIC enforce. |
| **Key Marketing Impact** | Spam Act prohibits address harvesting software and purchased scraped lists. Inferred consent from business relationships is relatively broad but must be documented. The Privacy Act's 2022 penalty increase makes Australia a high-consequence jurisdiction. Cross-border disclosure to overseas recipients requires reasonable steps to ensure compliance. |

### 1.9 Singapore — PDPA

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Region** | Singapore |
| **Law** | Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) |
| **Year Enacted** | 2012 (significant amendments 2021) |
| **Consent Model** | Opt-in for marketing. Deemed consent applies in limited situations (e.g., voluntarily providing data for a clear purpose). 2021 amendments added "legitimate interest" and "business improvement" exceptions. |
| **Email Rules** | Do Not Call (DNC) Registry: mandatory to check before sending marketing messages to Singapore numbers/addresses. Opt-out must be free and processed within 10 business days. Sender must be identified. |
| **Cookie/Tracking Rules** | No specific cookie consent law. PDPA's consent obligation applies if cookies collect personal data. PDPC advisory guidelines recommend transparency and consent for tracking. |
| **Penalty Range** | Up to SGD 1 million or 10% of annual turnover in Singapore (whichever is higher, following 2021 amendments). PDPC enforces. |
| **Key Marketing Impact** | DNC Registry check is mandatory and unique to Singapore — scrub all contact lists. Data breach notification mandatory within 3 days. Data Protection Officers must be appointed. Consent withdrawal must be easy. Cross-border transfers require comparable protection. |

### 1.10 China — PIPL

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Region** | People's Republic of China |
| **Law** | Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) |
| **Year Enacted** | 2021 (effective November 1, 2021) |
| **Consent Model** | Opt-in. Separate consent required for: sensitive personal information, cross-border transfers, public disclosure, and processing by third parties. Consent must be informed, voluntary, and explicit. |
| **Email Rules** | Marketing requires consent. Individuals have the right to refuse and withdraw. All processing purposes must be disclosed. No specific email-format statute like CAN-SPAM, but general consent and transparency obligations apply. |
| **Cookie/Tracking Rules** | Consent required for collection of personal information via cookies and trackers. Automated decision-making (algorithmic recommendations, targeted ads) must offer an opt-out and a non-personalized alternative. |
| **Penalty Range** | Up to RMB 50 million (~USD 7 million) or 5% of prior year's revenue. Responsible individuals can be fined up to RMB 1 million and banned from serving as directors/officers. CAC (Cyberspace Administration of China) enforces. |
| **Key Marketing Impact** | Data localization: personal information of Chinese residents must be stored in China unless a security assessment, standard contract, or certification is completed for cross-border transfer. Separate consent for each purpose. Personal Information Protection Impact Assessments required for sensitive data, automated decision-making, and cross-border transfers. Local DPO or representative required if processing from outside China. |

### 1.11 India — DPDPA

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Region** | India |
| **Law** | Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDPA) 2023, operationalised by the Digital Personal Data Protection Rules 2025 (notified by MeitY 3 Jan 2025; phased commencement through 2025-2026). |
| **Year Enacted** | 2023 (Rules 2025 finalised; consult MeitY notification for the phase-by-phase commencement schedule before designing for India). |
| **Consent Model** | Opt-in. Consent must be free, specific, informed, unconditional, and unambiguous, and must be requested in clear, plain language. Notice must accompany or precede the consent request (Rule 3). "Deemed consent" was removed in the 2023 Act and replaced with "Certain Legitimate Uses" (Section 7) — narrower than the 2022 draft. |
| **Email Rules** | Marketing requires verifiable consent. Withdrawal must be as easy as giving consent. The Consent Manager framework (registered entities that intermediate consent on behalf of Data Principals) is now live under Rule 4 — Data Fiduciaries handling material volumes should integrate with at least one registered Consent Manager. |
| **Cookie/Tracking Rules** | Cookie / SDK-based tracking that identifies a Data Principal is processing of personal data and requires DPDPA-compliant consent. The Rules do not carve out cookies; rely on the general processing-with-consent obligation. EU-style banner UX is the safest pattern. |
| **Penalty Range** | Up to INR 250 crore (~USD 30 million) per instance of non-compliance. No percentage-of-revenue calculation. The Data Protection Board of India (constituted under Rule 16 et seq) enforces and adjudicates. |
| **Key Marketing Impact** | Children's data (under 18) requires verifiable parental consent, and the Act prohibits targeted advertising and behavioural tracking directed at children — design age-gating and parental-consent flows before launching India campaigns to under-18 audiences. Cross-border transfers are permitted by default; Government may notify restricted countries by gazette (none broadly restricted as of July 2026 — verify before launch). Significant Data Fiduciaries (designated by the Government based on volume / sensitivity / risk) carry additional obligations: appoint an India-resident Data Protection Officer, conduct annual Data Protection Impact Assessments, and undergo periodic audits. Breach notification to the Board and affected Data Principals is mandatory without delay (Rule 7). |

### 1.12 Japan — APPI

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Region** | Japan |
| **Law** | Act on the Protection of Personal Information (APPI) |
| **Year Enacted** | 2003 (major amendments 2017, 2022) |
| **Consent Model** | Opt-in for provision to third parties and for use beyond the stated purpose. Opt-out mechanism available for third-party provision if registered with the PPC (Personal Information Protection Commission). 2022 amendments tightened opt-out rules and expanded individual rights. |
| **Email Rules** | Specified Electronic Mail Act: opt-in required for commercial email. Sender ID and unsubscribe required. APPI requires specifying the purpose of use at collection. |
| **Cookie/Tracking Rules** | 2022 amendments: "individually referable information" (e.g., cookie IDs that can be linked to personal info by a recipient) requires consent when provided to third parties. Cookie walls are discouraged. |
| **Penalty Range** | Criminal penalties for certain violations (up to JPY 100 million for corporations). PPC can issue orders and recommendations. Reputational enforcement is significant in Japan. 2022 amendments increased penalties. |
| **Key Marketing Impact** | Japan has an EU adequacy decision (mutual), facilitating EU-Japan data flows. Pseudonymized data has a specific legal regime — can be used for internal analytics without consent but cannot be provided to third parties. Breach notification to PPC and affected individuals is mandatory. "Individually referable information" concept means cookie syncing and DMP practices need consent. |

### 1.13 South Korea — PIPA

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Region** | South Korea |
| **Law** | Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA) |
| **Year Enacted** | 2011 (major amendments 2023, effective 2024) |
| **Consent Model** | Opt-in. Among the strictest globally. Consent must be separate from other terms, clearly distinguishable, and specific. Separate consent required for: collection, use, third-party provision, and cross-border transfer. |
| **Email Rules** | Opt-in required. The Act on Promotion of Information and Communications Network Utilization governs electronic marketing — consent must be verifiable, and opt-out must be honored immediately. Nighttime marketing (9 PM–8 AM) is restricted. |
| **Cookie/Tracking Rules** | 2023 amendments introduced a framework for pseudonymized data and behavioral advertising. Consent required for tracking that constitutes personal information processing. Online behavioral advertising requires notice and opt-out. |
| **Penalty Range** | Up to 3% of relevant revenue or KRW 600 million. Criminal penalties possible (up to 5 years imprisonment). PIPC (Personal Information Protection Commission) enforces. |
| **Key Marketing Impact** | Very granular consent requirements — separate checkboxes for each purpose and each third-party recipient. Nighttime contact restrictions are unique and must be coded into send-time logic. Resident Registration Numbers are highly restricted. 2023 amendments expanded extraterritorial reach and data subject rights. Cross-border transfer rules tightened. |

### 1.14 Saudi Arabia — PDPL

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Region** | Kingdom of Saudi Arabia |
| **Law** | Personal Data Protection Law (PDPL) |
| **Year Enacted** | 2021 (implementing regulations 2023; grace period until September 2024) |
| **Consent Model** | Opt-in. Consent must be explicit, informed, and freely given. Legitimate interest basis available but narrow. Sensitive data (health, financial, location, biometric, religious/ethnic data) requires explicit consent. |
| **Email Rules** | Marketing requires consent. Data subjects must be informed of the purpose before collection. Right to object to direct marketing. |
| **Cookie/Tracking Rules** | General consent obligation applies to collection of personal data via cookies. Specific cookie regulations expected as implementing rules evolve. |
| **Penalty Range** | Up to SAR 5 million (~USD 1.3 million). Criminal penalties for unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data (up to 2 years imprisonment). SDAIA (Saudi Data and Artificial Intelligence Authority) and NCC enforce. |
| **Key Marketing Impact** | Data localization: personal data of Saudi residents must be stored and processed in Saudi Arabia unless transfer conditions are met (adequacy, appropriate safeguards, or consent with risk disclosure). Arabic-language privacy notices likely required. DPO appointment required for certain controllers. Data breach notification within 72 hours. |

### 1.15 UAE — Federal Decree-Law No. 45

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Region** | United Arab Emirates (federal, outside free zones) |
| **Law** | Federal Decree-Law No. 45 of 2021 on the Protection of Personal Data |
| **Year Enacted** | 2021 (implementing regulations issued 2023–2024) |
| **Consent Model** | Opt-in. Consent must be clear, specific, informed, and unambiguous. Legitimate interest basis available. Sensitive data requires explicit consent. |
| **Email Rules** | Marketing requires consent or a legitimate interest basis. Right to object to direct marketing at any time. Free zone regulations (DIFC, ADGM) have their own data protection laws that may apply instead. |
| **Cookie/Tracking Rules** | General consent obligation for personal data processing extends to cookies and tracking. Await implementing regulations for specifics. |
| **Penalty Range** | Up to AED 20 million (~USD 5.4 million). UAE Data Office enforces. DIFC Commissioner and ADGM have separate penalty regimes for free zone entities. |
| **Key Marketing Impact** | Three overlapping regimes: federal law, DIFC (own law modeled on GDPR), and ADGM (own regulations). Determine which applies based on entity registration and data subject location. Cross-border transfer requires adequacy, contractual safeguards, or consent. Arabic-language notices advisable. Free zone entities should follow zone-specific rules which may be stricter. |

### 1.16 Thailand — PDPA

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Region** | Thailand |
| **Law** | Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) |
| **Year Enacted** | 2019 (fully enforced June 1, 2022) |
| **Consent Model** | Opt-in. Consent must be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous. Legitimate interest available as an alternative basis. Explicit consent required for sensitive data. Consent must be as easy to withdraw as to give. |
| **Email Rules** | Direct marketing requires consent or legitimate interest with opt-out. Right to object to marketing at any time. Sender identification required. |
| **Cookie/Tracking Rules** | Consent required for non-essential cookies. Thailand PDPA Committee guidance recommends cookie banners with granular choice. Functional and strictly necessary cookies may rely on legitimate interest. |
| **Penalty Range** | Administrative fines up to THB 5 million (~USD 140,000). Criminal penalties up to THB 1 million and/or 1 year imprisonment for certain violations. Punitive damages up to 2x actual damages in civil cases. PDPA Committee and Expert Committee enforce. |
| **Key Marketing Impact** | Structure is very similar to GDPR. DPO required for certain controllers. Data breach notification within 72 hours. Cross-border transfers require adequacy, appropriate safeguards, or consent. Thai-language privacy notices for Thai data subjects. Record of processing activities required. |

---

## Section 2: Industry-Specific Regulations

### 2.1 Healthcare — HIPAA / FDA

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Industry** | Healthcare, Health Services, Pharmaceuticals, Medical Devices |
| **Regulation** | HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, 1996); FDA regulations on drug/device advertising (21 CFR Parts 202, 801, 812) |

## Section 3: FTC Advertising Rules

### 3.1 FTC Endorsement Guides (Revised 2023)

| Rule | Requirement |
|---|---|
| **Material Connection Disclosure** | Any material connection between an endorser and the brand must be clearly and conspicuously disclosed. Material connections include: payment, free products, employment, family relationships, business partnerships, equity stakes, and affiliate commissions. |
| **Placement** | Disclosures must be in the same medium as the endorsement, unavoidable by the audience, and in clear language. For social media: within the post text (not hidden in hashtag strings), visible without clicking "more," and in the first lines of a caption. For video: spoken and in text overlay, not just in the description. |
| **Required Language** | Use clear terms: "#ad," "#sponsored," "Paid partnership with [Brand]." Ambiguous terms are insufficient: "#ambassador," "#collab," "#partner" alone do not meet FTC standards. Platform-specific disclosure tools (e.g., "Paid Partnership" tags) are helpful but may not be sufficient alone — a text disclosure is still recommended. |
| **Endorser Liability** | Both the brand AND the endorser can be held liable for non-disclosure. Brands must have reasonable monitoring programs for endorser compliance. Written agreements should include disclosure requirements. |
| **Honest Opinion** | Endorsements must reflect the honest opinion or experience of the endorser. Endorsers must have actually used the product/service. Scripts that misrepresent the endorser's experience violate FTC rules. |
| **Celebrity/Expert Endorsements** | Expert endorsers must have genuine expertise in the field. Celebrity endorsers must actually use the product. Expertise claims must be truthful. AI-generated or deepfake "endorsements" of real people without consent are deceptive. |

### 3.2 FTC Consumer Review Fairness and Rule on Fake Reviews (2024)

| Rule | Requirement |
|---|---|
| **Fake Reviews Ban** | Businesses may not create, buy, sell, or disseminate fake consumer reviews, testimonials, or celebrity endorsements. This includes reviews by employees or insiders not disclosing their connection. |
| **AI-Generated Reviews** | AI-generated reviews presented as human experiences are prohibited. AI-assisted review solicitation is permitted if the review reflects the genuine customer's experience. |
| **Review Suppression** | Businesses may not use unfounded legal threats, contract terms, or other means to suppress negative reviews. Filtering out only negative reviews while publishing positive ones is deceptive. |
| **Review Manipulation** | Buying positive reviews, incentivizing only positive reviews, or manipulating review platforms to boost ratings is prohibited. Soliciting reviews generally is permitted as long as the solicitation is not conditional on a positive review. |
| **Penalty** | Civil penalties per violation, inflation-adjusted annually (~$53K+ as of 2026). Applies to businesses, review brokers, and platforms that knowingly facilitate fake reviews. |

### 3.3 Influencer Disclosure Requirements

| Requirement | Detail |
|---|---|
| **When to Disclose** | Any time there is a material connection between the influencer and the brand — even for gifted products, affiliate links, or business relationships. |
| **How to Disclose** | Clear, unambiguous language at the beginning of the content. "#ad" at the start of social posts, spoken disclosure at the beginning of videos, and visible text in image posts. Must be understandable in the language of the audience. |
| **Platform-Specific** | Instagram/TikTok: "#ad" in first line + platform partnership label. YouTube: spoken + text in video + description box. Podcasts: spoken disclosure in the episode (not just show notes). Blog/newsletter: clear disclosure at the top of the post. |
| **Brand Responsibility** | Brands must: (1) clearly inform influencers of disclosure requirements in contracts, (2) monitor compliance, (3) take action when violations are found. A contractual clause alone is insufficient — active monitoring is required. |

### 3.4 AI-Generated Content Disclosure

| Requirement | Detail |
|---|---|
| **FTC Position** | AI-generated content that could be mistaken for human-created content must be disclosed. This includes AI-generated images, text, voices, and video used in marketing. |
| **Deepfakes** | Using AI to create realistic depictions of real people without their consent is deceptive. AI-generated endorsements by fabricated "people" must be disclosed as AI-generated. |
| **AI in Reviews** | AI-generated reviews are fake reviews under FTC rules. AI tools may assist humans in writing reviews, but the review must reflect genuine experience. |
| **Best Practice** | Disclose AI involvement in content creation when a reasonable consumer would consider it material. Label AI-generated imagery clearly. Do not use AI voices mimicking real individuals without consent and disclosure. |

### 3.5 Testimonial Rules

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Typicality** | If a testimonial describes results that are not typical, the ad must clearly disclose what results consumers can generally expect. "Results not typical" alone is insufficient — must state typical results. |
| **Truthfulness** | Testimonials must reflect honest, genuine experiences. Cannot be fabricated, materially altered, or taken out of context. |
| **Substantiation** | Claims made through testimonials are treated as claims by the advertiser and must be substantiated. |
| **Expert Endorsements** | Must be supported by an actual examination, testing, or evaluation by the expert. The expert must have qualifications in the relevant field. |

### 3.6 FTC Penalty Structure

| Violation Type | Penalty Range |
|---|---|
| **Section 5 (Unfair or Deceptive Acts)** | Consent orders, cease and desist, corrective advertising. No direct fines for first-time Section 5 violations, but violation of a consent order: civil penalties per violation, inflation-adjusted annually (~$53K+ as of 2026). |
| **Penalty Offense Authority** | FTC can seek civil penalties from companies that had prior notice that conduct is unlawful (via prior FTC cases). Per-violation civil penalty, inflation-adjusted annually (~$53K+ as of 2026). |
| **Fake Reviews Rule (2024)** | Civil penalties per violation, inflation-adjusted annually (~$53K+ as of 2026). |
| **COPPA Violations** | Per-violation civil penalty, inflation-adjusted annually (~$53K+ as of 2026). |
| **Restitution/Disgorgement** | FTC can seek consumer redress through federal courts. AMG Capital Management v. FTC (2021) limited FTC's Section 13(b) authority, but Congress is working to restore it. |

| **1.3.2 Meaningful Sequence** | Content reading order is correct when linearized. | Email layouts must make sense when CSS is disabled or images don't load. Single-column fallback for responsive emails. |
| **1.4.1 Use of Color** | Color is not the only visual means of conveying information. | CTA buttons must not rely solely on color to indicate interactivity. Error states in forms need text labels, not just red highlighting. Charts need patterns or labels in addition to color coding. |

| **2.4.6 Headings and Labels** | Headings and labels describe topic or purpose. | Landing page sections need descriptive headings. Form labels must clearly describe the expected input. |
| **2.4.7 Focus Visible** | Keyboard focus indicator is visible. | Do not remove outline styles from interactive elements on landing pages. Custom focus indicators must meet 3:1 contrast. |
| **3.1.1 Language of Page** | Default human language of each page is programmatically determinable. | Set `lang` attribute on HTML element. Multilingual marketing pages need `lang` attributes on sections in different languages. |
| **3.2.1 On Focus** | No context change on focus. | No auto-redirect, modal popup, or form submission triggered solely by focusing an element. |
| **3.2.2 On Input** | No context change on input unless user is informed beforehand. | Form field changes should not trigger page navigation. Auto-submit on dropdown selection is non-compliant without warning. |

| **Marketing Implications** | All landing pages, microsites, campaign pages, and promotional web content must be WCAG 2.2 AA compliant. Pop-ups and modals must be keyboard-accessible and screen-reader-compatible. Video content needs captions. PDFs (whitepapers, ebooks) must be tagged for accessibility.

| **Link Styling** | Links must be distinguishable from surrounding text by more than just color (underline is standard). Link text must be descriptive. Avoid multiple links with identical text pointing to different URLs. |
| **Structure** | Single-column layouts are most accessible. If multi-column, ensure proper reading order in code. Use `dir` and `lang` attributes. Avoid relying on CSS-only layout that breaks in stripped-down email clients. |
| **Dark Mode** | Test in dark mode. Use transparent PNGs or match background colors. Ensure text remains readable when background colors are overridden. Provide both light and dark mode color declarations where supported. |
| **Screen Reader** | Include a `role="article"` on the main content wrapper. Use `aria-label` for navigation links if applicable. Avoid "View in browser" as the only way to access content. Preheader text should be meaningful (it's read aloud by screen readers). |
| **Auto-Applied Rules** | Flag images without alt text. Flag text below 4.5:1 contrast ratio. Flag body text below 14px. Flag link text that says "Click here" or "Read more." Flag layout tables without `role="presentation"`. Require single-column fallback for mobile/accessibility. |

## Rule Application Reference

When the context engine evaluates marketing content, apply rules in this priority order:

1. **Geographic law** — Identify target audience jurisdiction(s) and apply ALL applicable privacy/consent rules
2. **Industry regulation** — Identify the advertiser's industry and apply sector-specific restrictions
3. **FTC advertising rules** — Apply to all US-targeted content regardless of industry
4. **Platform policies** — Apply the specific platform's rules for the distribution channel
5. **Accessibility** — Apply WCAG 2.2 AA and email accessibility standards to all outputs

When rules conflict, apply the **most restrictive** standard. When jurisdiction is unknown, default to **GDPR + CPRA + FTC** as the baseline.

### Severity Levels

| Level | Definition | Action |
|---|---|---|
| **BLOCK** | Violation would be illegal or result in platform ban (false health claims, missing disclosures on regulated products, COPPA violations, discriminatory targeting). | Do not output. Flag to user with specific rule citation. |
| **WARN** | Likely violation requiring human review (ambiguous claims, missing disclaimers, potential trademark issues, accessibility gaps). | Output with prominent warning and recommended fix. |
| **SUGGEST** | Best practice not strictly required by law but reduces risk (double opt-in where only opt-out required, adding disclaimers proactively, exceeding minimum contrast ratios). | Output with suggestion as a footnote. |
