# CRM Integration Guide — Connection Patterns & Data Sync

How the Digital Marketing Pro plugin connects to CRMs, maps marketing data to CRM objects, and keeps records synchronized across systems.

---

## Section 1: Supported CRMs

| CRM | MCP Server | Auth Type | Read | Write | Key Objects |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Salesforce** | `mcp-salesforce` | OAuth 2.0 | Yes | Yes | Leads, Contacts, Accounts, Opportunities, Campaigns |
| **HubSpot** | `@anthropic/mcp-hubspot` | API Key / OAuth | Yes | Yes (beta) | Contacts, Companies, Deals, Tickets |
| **Zoho CRM** | `mcp-zoho-crm` | OAuth 2.0 | Yes | Yes | Leads, Contacts, Accounts, Deals, Campaigns |
| **Pipedrive** | `mcp-pipedrive` | API Token | Yes | Yes | Persons, Organizations, Deals, Activities |
| **Odoo CRM** | `mcp-odoo` | API Key + DB Name | Yes | Yes | Leads, Contacts, Opportunities, Activities, Campaigns, Invoices |
| **Freshsales** | `mcp-freshsales` | API Key | Yes | Yes | Contacts, Accounts, Deals, Tasks, Sales Sequences |
| **Monday.com CRM** | `mcp-monday-crm` | API Token / OAuth | Yes | Yes | Boards, Items, Columns, Groups, Updates |
| **Microsoft Dynamics 365** | `mcp-dynamics-365` | OAuth 2.0 | Yes | Yes | Leads, Contacts, Accounts, Opportunities, Campaigns |
| **Copper CRM** | `mcp-copper` | API Key + Email | Yes | Yes | People, Companies, Opportunities, Projects, Tasks |
| **Close CRM** | `mcp-close-crm` | API Key (Basic Auth) | Yes | Yes | Leads, Contacts, Opportunities, Activities, Sequences |
| **Keap** | `mcp-keap` | OAuth 2.0 | Yes | Yes | Contacts, Companies, Deals, Tags, Campaigns, Orders |

**Setup:** Set the relevant API key or OAuth credentials in `.env`. The MCP server configuration in `.mcp.json` handles connection routing. Each brand can use a different CRM (see Section 7: Multi-CRM Setup). The MCP server package names above are illustrative — verify the package exists on npm before use (`npx` executes remote code), or use `/digital-marketing-pro:add-integration` to wire a custom connector.

> **How the two layers fit together (read this first).** `crm-sync.py` never writes to a CRM. It is the *local* preparation and bookkeeping layer: it validates and field-maps records (`prepare-contact`, `prepare-deal`), checks the local dedup index (`check-dedup`), records what was pushed (`log-synced`), and reports state (`get-sync-history`, `get-crm-status`, `audit-workflows`, `create-campaign`). The actual read/write against the CRM is performed by the **connected CRM MCP server** — the model calls the MCP's create/update tool with the payload `prepare-contact`/`prepare-deal` returns. Every example below follows the same shape: **prepare with `crm-sync.py` → write via the CRM MCP → record with `log-synced`.** `crm-sync.py --action` accepts only: `prepare-contact`, `prepare-deal`, `check-dedup`, `log-synced`, `get-sync-history`, `get-crm-status`, `audit-workflows`, `create-campaign` (plus `--brand`, `--data`, `--platform`, `--type`, `--limit`, `--plan`). There is no `push`, `setup-fields`, `dsr`, or `opt-out` action, and no `--crm`, `--object`, `--email`, or `--phone` flag.

---

## Section 2: Field Mapping

How brand profile and marketing data fields map to CRM object fields across platforms.

### Contact & Company Fields

| Brand Profile / Marketing Field | Salesforce | HubSpot | Zoho | Pipedrive |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `company_name` | Account.Name | Company.name | Account.Account_Name | Organization.name |
| `contact.email` | Lead.Email / Contact.Email | Contact.email | Lead.Email / Contact.Email | Person.email |
| `contact.phone` | Lead.Phone / Contact.Phone | Contact.phone | Lead.Phone / Contact.Phone | Person.phone |
| `contact.first_name` | Lead.FirstName | Contact.firstname | Lead.First_Name | Person.first_name |
| `contact.last_name` | Lead.LastName | Contact.lastname | Lead.Last_Name | Person.last_name |
| `contact.title` | Lead.Title | Contact.jobtitle | Lead.Designation | Person.job_title |
| `contact.source` | Lead.LeadSource | Contact.hs_lead_source | Lead.Lead_Source | Person.source |

### Deal & Campaign Fields

| Marketing Field | Salesforce | HubSpot | Zoho | Pipedrive |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `deal_value` | Opportunity.Amount | Deal.amount | Deal.Amount | Deal.value |
| `deal_stage` | Opportunity.StageName | Deal.dealstage | Deal.Stage | Deal.stage_id |
| `deal_close_date` | Opportunity.CloseDate | Deal.closedate | Deal.Closing_Date | Deal.expected_close_date |
| `campaign_name` | Campaign.Name | (custom property) | Campaign.Campaign_Name | (custom field) |
| `campaign_status` | Campaign.Status | (custom property) | Campaign.Status | (custom field) |
| `utm_source` | Lead.UTM_Source__c (custom) | Contact.hs_analytics_source | Lead.UTM_Source (custom) | Person.utm_source (custom) |

**Note:** Fields marked "(custom)" require creating a custom field/property in the CRM before the plugin can write to them. The plugin does NOT create CRM schema — create custom fields in the CRM's own admin UI (or via the connected CRM MCP if it exposes a schema tool), then map them in `--data` when you call `prepare-contact` / `prepare-deal`.

### Extended Platform Contact & Company Fields

| Brand Profile / Marketing Field | Odoo | Freshsales | Monday.com CRM | Dynamics 365 | Copper | Close | Keap |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `company_name` | res.partner.name (company type) | Account.name | Board item (custom column) | Account.name | Company.name | Lead.display_name | Company.company_name |
| `contact.email` | res.partner.email | Contact.emails[0].value | Item email column | Contact.emailaddress1 | Person.emails[0].email | Contact.emails[0].email | Contact.email_addresses[0].email |
| `contact.phone` | res.partner.phone | Contact.phones[0].value | Item phone column | Contact.telephone1 | Person.phone_numbers[0].number | Contact.phones[0].phone | Contact.phone_numbers[0].number |
| `contact.first_name` | res.partner.name (parsed) | Contact.first_name | Item name (parsed) | Contact.firstname | Person.name (parsed) | Contact.name (parsed) | Contact.given_name |
| `contact.last_name` | res.partner.name (parsed) | Contact.last_name | Item name (parsed) | Contact.lastname | Person.name (parsed) | Contact.name (parsed) | Contact.family_name |
| `contact.title` | res.partner.function | Contact.job_title | Item text column (custom) | Contact.jobtitle | Person.title | Contact.title | Contact.job_title |
| `contact.source` | crm.lead.source_id | Contact.lead_source_id | Item status column (custom) | Lead.leadsourcecode | Person.source (custom) | Lead.source (custom) | Contact.source_type |

### Extended Platform Deal & Campaign Fields

| Marketing Field | Odoo | Freshsales | Monday.com CRM | Dynamics 365 | Copper | Close | Keap |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `deal_value` | crm.lead.expected_revenue | Deal.amount | Item number column | Opportunity.estimatedvalue | Opportunity.monetary_value | Opportunity.value | Deal.deal_value |
| `deal_stage` | crm.lead.stage_id | Deal.deal_stage_id | Item status column | Opportunity.salesstagecode | Opportunity.pipeline_stage_id | Opportunity.status_id | Deal.stage.name |
| `deal_close_date` | crm.lead.date_deadline | Deal.expected_close | Item date column | Opportunity.estimatedclosedate | Opportunity.close_date | Opportunity.date_won | Deal.next_action_date |
| `campaign_name` | utm.campaign.name | (custom field) | Board name or group name | Campaign.name | (custom field) | (custom field) | Campaign.campaign_name |
| `campaign_status` | utm.campaign.stage_id | (custom field) | Item status column | Campaign.statuscode | (custom field) | (custom field) | Campaign.status |
| `utm_source` | crm.lead.source_id | Contact.utm_source (custom) | Item text column (custom) | Lead.utm_source (custom) | Person.utm_source (custom) | Lead.utm_source (custom) | Contact.utm_source (custom) |

---

## Section 3: Data Sync Patterns

### One-Way Push (Plugin to CRM)

The most common pattern. The plugin is the source of truth for marketing data and the CRM MCP writes it into the CRM.

| Use Case | Trigger | crm-sync.py prepare step | CRM MCP write |
|---|---|---|---|
| Lead import from campaign | Campaign execution or form submission | `prepare-contact` | Create Lead/Contact |
| Deal update from pipeline analysis | Pipeline review or scoring change | `prepare-deal` | Update Opportunity/Deal |
| Campaign record creation | Campaign launch via `/digital-marketing-pro:launch-campaign` (or `/digital-marketing-pro:launch-ad-campaign` for paid-ads only) | `create-campaign` | Create Campaign object |
| Activity logging | Email send, ad click, webinar registration | (log after the fact) | Create Activity/Task |

```bash
# 1. Prepare + field-map the record locally (validates; does NOT write to the CRM)
python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/crm-sync.py" --brand {slug} --action prepare-contact --data '{"email": "user@example.com", "source": "q3-webinar"}'
# 2. Write the returned payload via the connected CRM MCP (the MCP's create/update tool)
# 3. Record the write so the audit trail + dedup index stay current
python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/crm-sync.py" --brand {slug} --action log-synced --data '{"platform": "salesforce", "record_type": "contact", "crm_id": "..."}'
```

### Two-Way Sync (Plugin and CRM)

Used when both systems hold authoritative data. The CRM has sales activity and deal progression; the plugin has marketing engagement and scoring.

| Direction | Data | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Plugin → CRM | Marketing score, campaign membership, content engagement | Lead score updated from 45 to 82 |
| CRM → Plugin | Deal stage changes, revenue data, sales feedback | Deal moved to "Closed Won" — attribute to campaign |

**Conflict resolution:** Last-write-wins with audit trail. Every sync operation logs: field, old value, new value, source (plugin or CRM), timestamp. Audit log at `~/.claude-marketing/brands/{slug}/crm-sync-log.json`.

### Event-Triggered Sync

Automated syncs fired by specific marketing or sales events.

| Event | Sync Action |
|---|---|
| Campaign execution | Create/update CRM Campaign record |
| Lead form submission | Create CRM Lead with UTM data |
| Lead score crosses threshold (80+) | Update CRM Lead status to "Sales-Ready", notify sales |
| Deal stage changes to "Closed Won" | Trigger attribution update in plugin |
| Email hard bounce | Update CRM Contact status to "Invalid Email" |

---

## Section 4: Deduplication Rules

Before creating any CRM record, the plugin checks for existing matches. Rules are applied in priority order:

| Priority | Method | Match Criteria | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Email match | Exact match, case-insensitive | Highest |
| 2 | Phone match | Normalized: strip spaces, dashes, parentheses, country code prefix | High |
| 3 | Company + Name | Company name exact + contact name fuzzy (Levenshtein distance ≤ 2) | Medium |
| 4 | Domain match | Extract domain from email → match to company | Company-level only |

**Always check dedup BEFORE creating records** (email/phone go inside `--data`, not as flags):
```bash
python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/crm-sync.py" --brand {slug} --action check-dedup --data '{"email": "user@example.com", "phone": "+1-555-0123"}'
```

**Merge behavior:** When a match is found, the plugin updates the existing record rather than creating a duplicate. If multiple matches are found, the highest-confidence match is used and the others are flagged for manual review.

---

## Section 5: Campaign Linking

How marketing campaigns connect to CRM campaign objects for attribution and reporting.

| CRM | Campaign Object | Lead/Contact Association | Attribution Model |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Salesforce** | Campaign | CampaignMember (links Leads/Contacts to Campaign with Status and ResponseDate) | Influence model via CampaignInfluence or custom attribution |
| **HubSpot** | Custom properties or Campaigns (Marketing Hub Professional+) | Contact timeline events, custom association | HubSpot attribution reports or custom |
| **Zoho** | Campaign | Associate Leads/Contacts via Campaign Member | Zoho Campaign analytics or custom |
| **Pipedrive** | Custom fields or Activities linked to Deals | Activity association on Deal/Person | Custom attribution via plugin |
| **Odoo CRM** | utm.campaign | Link Leads/Contacts via `campaign_id` on `crm.lead` | UTM-based attribution via source/medium/campaign fields |
| **Freshsales** | Custom field on Deal/Contact | Sales Sequence membership, custom associations | Custom attribution via plugin |
| **Monday.com CRM** | Board group or dedicated Campaign board | Item links (connect items across boards) | Custom attribution via plugin dashboards |
| **Microsoft Dynamics 365** | Campaign entity | Campaign Response links Leads/Contacts with response type and date | Built-in campaign attribution reports, custom via Power BI |
| **Copper CRM** | Custom field on Opportunity/Project | Tag or custom field association on People/Companies | Custom attribution via plugin |
| **Close CRM** | Custom field on Lead | Smart View filter + custom field tagging | Custom attribution via plugin |
| **Keap** | Campaign (visual campaign builder) | Tag-based campaign membership on Contacts | Built-in campaign reporting, tag-based attribution |

**Plugin tracking:** Every campaign execution logs its `crm_campaign_id` via the execution tracker (all fields go inside `--data`; there are no `--campaign-id` / `--crm-campaign-id` flags):
```bash
python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/execution-tracker.py" --brand {slug} --action log-execution --data '{"campaign_id": "{id}", "crm_campaign_id": "{crm_id}", "action": "campaign-link", "result": "success"}'
```

This creates a bidirectional link: the plugin knows which CRM campaign corresponds to each marketing campaign, and the CRM campaign links back to the plugin's campaign ID via a custom field.

---

## Section 6: Lead Scoring Integration

The plugin's lead scoring system (defined in `skills/marketing-automation/lead-scoring.md`) generates a 0-100 marketing score. This score must be synced to the CRM for sales team visibility.

### Score Field Mapping

| CRM | Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Salesforce** | `Lead.Marketing_Score__c` / `Contact.Marketing_Score__c` | Number (custom field) | Create via Setup > Object Manager > Fields |
| **HubSpot** | `hubspot_score` (built-in) or custom contact property | Number | Built-in scoring available in Marketing Hub Professional+ |
| **Zoho** | `Marketing_Score` (custom field) | Number | Create via Settings > Modules > Fields |
| **Pipedrive** | Custom field on Person | Number | Create via Settings > Data fields |
| **Odoo CRM** | `crm.lead.priority` or custom field `x_marketing_score` | Integer | Create via Settings > Technical > Fields or API `ir.model.fields` |
| **Freshsales** | `lead_score` (built-in) or custom contact field | Number | Built-in Freddy AI scoring available; custom field for plugin score |
| **Monday.com CRM** | Number column on Contact/Lead board | Number | Add column via board settings or API |
| **Microsoft Dynamics 365** | `lead.msdyn_marketingscore` or custom field `new_marketingscore` | Whole Number | Create via Power Apps > Tables > Lead > Columns |
| **Copper CRM** | Custom field on Person | Number | Create via Settings > Custom Fields |
| **Close CRM** | Custom field on Lead | Number | Create via Settings > Custom Fields > Lead |
| **Keap** | Custom field on Contact or Tag-based scoring | Number | Create via Settings > Custom Fields; or use tag thresholds |

### Sync Frequency

| Trigger | Action |
|---|---|
| Score change (any amount) | Queue sync — batch executes every 15 minutes |
| Score crosses a threshold boundary | Immediate sync + notification |
| Daily batch (midnight local) | Full reconciliation of all scored leads |

### Threshold Actions

| Score Range | Status | CRM Action |
|---|---|---|
| 80-100 | Sales-Ready | Update Lead status, notify assigned sales rep, create Task/Activity |
| 50-79 | Nurture | Enroll in nurture sequence, update Lead status to "Marketing Qualified" |
| 20-49 | Cold | Continue automated nurture, no sales notification |
| 0-19 | Inactive | Flag for re-engagement campaign or suppression after 90 days |

## Section 7: Multi-CRM Setup (Agency Pattern)

Agencies managing multiple brands can connect each brand to a different CRM.

**How it works:**
- Credential profiles (`credential-manager.py`) map each brand to its CRM and credentials
- The active CRM is determined by the brand's credential profile via the `default_crm` field
- Switching brands (via `/digital-marketing-pro:switch-brand`) automatically switches CRM context

**Credential profile structure:**
```json
{
  "brand_slug": "acme-corp",
  "default_crm": "salesforce",
  "crm_credentials": {
    "salesforce": {
      "env_prefix": "ACME_SF"
    }
  }
}
```

**Environment variables follow the pattern:** `{ENV_PREFIX}_CLIENT_ID`, `{ENV_PREFIX}_CLIENT_SECRET`, `{ENV_PREFIX}_REFRESH_TOKEN`.

**Example multi-brand setup:**

| Brand | CRM | Env Prefix | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Acme Corp | Salesforce | `ACME_SF` | Enterprise CRM, full read/write |
| BetaWidget | HubSpot | `BETA_HS` | Marketing Hub Professional |
| LocalShop | Pipedrive | `LOCAL_PD` | Small business, deal-focused |
| HealthCo | Zoho CRM | `HEALTH_ZO` | HIPAA-aware configuration |
| MfgDirect | Odoo CRM | `MFG_ODOO` | Open-source, self-hosted with ERP integration |
| SaaSFlow | Freshsales | `SAAS_FS` | Built-in phone/email, Freddy AI scoring |
| CreativeHub | Monday.com CRM | `CREATIVE_MON` | Visual pipeline, Kanban-focused |
| GlobalEnterp | Dynamics 365 | `GLOBAL_DYN` | Enterprise, Microsoft 365 ecosystem |
| DesignStudio | Copper | `DESIGN_CU` | Gmail-native, Google Workspace integration |
| InsideSales | Close CRM | `INSIDE_CL` | Built-in calling/SMS, power dialer |
| CoachPro | Keap | `COACH_KP` | All-in-one with marketing automation + e-commerce |

## Section 9: Data Privacy

### GDPR Compliance

| Requirement | Implementation |
|---|---|
| Document legal basis for processing | Store `consent_basis` field on every CRM record (consent, legitimate interest, contract) |
| Respect data subject requests | Execute access/delete/portability against the CRM through the connected CRM MCP (its read/delete tools) per the brand's compliance workflow; there is no `dsr` action in `crm-sync.py`. Record the fulfilled request via `--action log-synced --data '{"platform":"...","record_type":"dsr","note":"access\|delete\|port"}'` for the audit trail |
| Data retention policy | Configure max retention per brand; auto-flag records exceeding retention period |
| Data Processing Agreements | Required with every CRM vendor — verify before connecting |

### CCPA Compliance

| Requirement | Implementation |
|---|---|
| Honor opt-out requests | Apply the suppression in the CRM via the connected CRM MCP, then record it with `--action log-synced --data '{"platform":"...","record_type":"opt-out","email":"..."}'` so future `check-dedup`/prepare steps see the suppression. There is no `opt-out` action in `crm-sync.py` |
| Do not sell data | Plugin never transfers CRM data to third parties |
| Disclosure on collection | Lead forms must include privacy notice linking to brand's privacy policy |

### General Security Rules

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| Credential storage | CRM credentials in `.env` ONLY — never in marketing data files, campaign plans, or logs |
| Audit trail | Every CRM write operation logged with: timestamp, user/agent, action, fields modified, old/new values |
| Access logging | All CRM read operations logged with: timestamp, query, records accessed, purpose |
| Cross-border transfers | If brand operates in multiple jurisdictions, apply the most restrictive privacy rules across all CRM operations |
| Encryption | All MCP connections use TLS. No CRM data stored in plaintext intermediate files |

### Privacy by Default

When creating new CRM integrations:
1. Start with read-only access — add write permissions only when needed
2. Minimize data synced — only push fields required for the use case
3. Set retention limits at connection time
4. Enable audit logging before the first sync
5. Document the data flow in the brand's credential profile
