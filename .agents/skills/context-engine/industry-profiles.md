# Industry Profiles Reference

> **Benchmark provenance (as of 2026-08):** Dollar figures in this document are planning priors, not quotes — market and auction rates drift continuously. Before any figure enters a media plan, budget, or client deliverable, refresh it live (platform dashboards and current published reports beat memory) and record it with `python scripts/benchmark_book.py --action record ... --source <url>`; quote from the book thereafter (`--action quote`). Never present an unstamped figure as current market fact.

> **Purpose:** Machine-readable reference for marketing modules. Each profile provides benchmarks, channel priorities, compliance notes, and strategic context so the agent can tailor recommendations to the client's industry without hallucinating numbers.
>
> **Last updated:** 2026-02-11
>
> **Usage:** When a workflow or module needs industry-specific data, look up the relevant profile below. All KPI ranges represent typical mid-market performance (not top-decile or bottom-decile). Adjust recommendations based on company maturity and budget.

- Not showcasing completed work with professional photography
- Ignoring online reputation management
- Failing to capture and follow up on leads systematically
- Not differentiating (specialization vs. "we do everything")
- Missing the planning/research phase — clients research months before hiring

## 22. Agriculture / AgTech

**Funnel Model:** Seasonal decision-cycle funnel. Input purchases (seed, chemicals, equipment): 30-90 days before planting season. AgTech adoption: 60-180 days. Dealer relationships are critical.

**Top Marketing Channels (ranked):**

| Rank | Channel | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| 1 | Trade Shows / Field Days | In-person demos and relationship building |
| 2 | Industry Publications (Farm Journal, AgWeb) | Trusted editorial channels |
| 3 | Dealer / Distributor Networks | Channel partner marketing |
| 4 | SEO / Content Marketing | Technical and agronomic content |
| 5 | Email Marketing | Seasonal campaigns, product updates |
| 6 | Social Media (Facebook, YouTube) | Farm community engagement, demo videos |

**Benchmark KPIs:**

| Metric | Range |
|--------|-------|
| Search CTR | 2.5% - 5.0% |
| Social CTR (Facebook) | 0.5% - 1.2% |
| CPC (Search) | $1.00 - $5.00 |
| CPC (Meta) | $0.50 - $2.50 |
| Lead Conversion Rate | 2% - 5% |
| Email Open Rate | 22% - 32% |
| Trade Show Lead Conversion | 10% - 20% |
| Sales Cycle (AgTech) | 3 - 12 months |

**Compliance Requirements:**
- **EPA** regulations for crop protection product advertising
- FIFRA (Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act) label compliance
- USDA organic certification claims must be verified
- State Department of Agriculture advertising rules
- Seed labeling and performance claim regulations
- Environmental and sustainability claim substantiation
- Equipment safety and performance disclaimers

**Preferred Content Formats:**
- Field trial results and agronomic data
- Product demonstration videos (equipment in action)
- Farmer testimonial stories
- Technical bulletins and spec sheets
- ROI calculators (yield improvement, cost savings)
- Seasonal planting and management guides
- Podcast content (growing channel in ag)

**Seasonal Peaks:**
- Pre-planting (January-March): Input purchasing decisions
- Planting season (April-May): Last-minute purchases
- Growing season (June-August): Crop protection, scouting
- Harvest (September-November): Equipment, storage
- Winter (December-February): Planning, trade shows, education events

**AEO/GEO Considerations:**
- Niche audience but growing digital sophistication
- Schema markup: Product, Organization, Article
- Optimize for "[crop] [problem] solution" and "best [input] for [crop]"
- Precision agriculture and AgTech content is increasingly searched
- AI-powered agronomic advisory tools are emerging — structured trial data feeds these systems
- Regional and climate-specific content matters significantly

**Common Pitfalls:**
- Assuming farmers aren't digital — they research extensively online
- Marketing only through dealers without building brand awareness
- Technical jargon without explaining benefits in practical terms
- Ignoring the seasonal buying cycle (marketing when decisions are already made)
- Not providing ROI justification — farmers are data-driven buyers
- Underinvesting in video content showing products in real field conditions

| Agriculture/AgTech | 2.5% - 5.0% | $1.00 - $5.00 | 2% - 5% | 22% - 32% |

> **Note on conversion rate context:** Home Services and Fitness show high "conversion rates" because their conversion events are phone calls/trial sign-ups (lower commitment). Industries like eCommerce and SaaS measure direct purchases/sign-ups. Do not compare conversion rates across industries without understanding what the conversion event is.
