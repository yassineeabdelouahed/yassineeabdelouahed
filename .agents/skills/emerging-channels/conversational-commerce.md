# Conversational Commerce — Chat, SMS & Messaging

> **Benchmark provenance (as of 2026-08):** Dollar figures in this document are planning priors, not quotes — market and auction rates drift continuously. Before any figure enters a media plan, budget, or client deliverable, refresh it live (platform dashboards and current published reports beat memory) and record it with `python scripts/benchmark_book.py --action record ... --source <url>`; quote from the book thereafter (`--action quote`). Never present an unstamped figure as current market fact.

> Conversational commerce is the intersection of messaging and buying. Customers increasingly expect to discover, evaluate, and purchase products within chat interfaces. This guide covers every major messaging channel, compliance requirements, and measurement frameworks.

### Chatbot Design Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Identify the bot** | Always disclose that the user is chatting with a bot, not a human |
| **Limit scope** | Define 5-10 core intents the bot handles well; escalate everything else |
| **Provide human escalation** | "Talk to a human" option available at every step |
| **Use quick replies** | Offer button options to guide the conversation (reduce free-text friction) |
| **Handle dead ends** | Every unrecognized input gets a graceful fallback ("I didn't quite get that. Here are some things I can help with:") |
| **Personalize** | Use customer name, order history, browsing context when available |
| **Keep it short** | Messages under 60 words; break long responses into multiple messages |
| **Confirm actions** | Always confirm before processing orders, bookings, or account changes |

### Chatbot Platform Comparison

| Platform | Best For | AI Capability | Channels Supported | Pricing |
|----------|---------|---------------|-------------------|---------|
| **ManyChat** | SMBs, e-commerce | Rule-based + AI | Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp, SMS | Free tier + $15+/mo |
