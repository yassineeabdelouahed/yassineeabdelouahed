# Video Marketing — Format & Distribution Guide

> **Benchmark provenance (as of 2026-08):** Dollar figures in this document are planning priors, not quotes — market and auction rates drift continuously. Before any figure enters a media plan, budget, or client deliverable, refresh it live (platform dashboards and current published reports beat memory) and record it with `python scripts/benchmark_book.py --action record ... --source <url>`; quote from the book thereafter (`--action quote`). Never present an unstamped figure as current market fact.

> Video is the dominant content format across every major platform. This guide covers format specifications, production tiers, SEO optimization, distribution strategy, and repurposing workflows to maximize the ROI of every video asset you produce.

2. Test different text overlays

## Repurposing Workflow — Long-Form to Multi-Platform

### The Content Waterfall

```
Long-Form Video (8-15 min, YouTube)
│
├─→ 3-5 Short Clips (30-60 sec) → TikTok, Reels, Shorts
│
├─→ Audiogram (60-90 sec, waveform visual) → Twitter/X, LinkedIn
│
├─→ Key Frames / Screenshots → Quote graphics for Instagram, LinkedIn
│
├─→ Transcript → Blog post (SEO) + Newsletter excerpt
│
├─→ Audio Extract → Podcast feed (if applicable)
│
├─→ Key Insights → Twitter/X thread (5-8 tweets)
│
└─→ Slide Deck → LinkedIn document post / SlideShare
```

### Clip Selection Criteria

When choosing which moments to extract as short-form clips:

| Criteria | Why |
|----------|-----|
| **Self-contained insight** | Clip must make sense without context from the full video |
| **Strong hook** | First 1-2 seconds grab attention |
| **Emotional reaction** | Surprise, humor, strong opinion, controversial take |
| **Actionable tip** | Viewers can implement something immediately |
| **Visual demonstration** | Something being shown, not just discussed |
| **Natural ending** | Clip has a satisfying conclusion (not mid-sentence cutoff) |

### Editing Workflow for Repurposing

| Step | Tool | Time Estimate |
|------|------|--------------|
| 1. Record long-form video | Camera + audio setup | 30-60 min |
| 2. Edit long-form version | Premiere Pro, Final Cut, DaVinci Resolve | 2-4 hours |
| 3. Auto-transcribe | Descript, Otter.ai, Premiere auto-transcribe | 5 minutes |
| 4. Identify clip-worthy moments | Review transcript, mark timestamps | 30 minutes |
| 5. Export vertical clips (9:16) | Premiere Pro auto-reframe or CapCut | 30-60 min |
| 6. Add captions to clips | CapCut auto-captions, Descript, Zubtitle | 15-30 min |
| 7. Create audiograms | Headliner, Descript | 15 min |
| 8. Pull quote screenshots | Canva template | 15 min |
| 9. Edit transcript into blog post | Manual editing | 30-60 min |
| 10. Schedule across platforms | Buffer, Hootsuite, Later, or native scheduling | 15 min |

**Total time to produce 10+ content pieces from one video: 5-8 hours**

## Video Content Calendar Template

| Week | Long-Form (YouTube) | Short-Form (TikTok/Reels/Shorts) | LinkedIn | Twitter/X |
|------|--------------------|---------------------------------|----------|-----------|
| 1 | Tutorial: "How to {{topic}}" | 3 clips from tutorial + 2 trending/reactive | 1 native video (insight from tutorial) | 2 clips + 1 thread |
| 2 | Interview/podcast episode | 3 clips from interview + 2 trending | 1 thought leadership video | 2 clips + 1 thread |
| 3 | List/review: "Top 5 {{tools}}" | 3 clips from list + 2 trending | 1 case study video | 2 clips + 1 thread |
| 4 | Behind-the-scenes / vlog | 3 clips from BTS + 2 trending | 1 industry commentary | 2 clips + 1 thread |

**Monthly output from this calendar: 4 long-form + 20 short-form + 4 LinkedIn + 12 Twitter = 40 video pieces**

---

> **The best video strategy is not about producing more — it is about producing once and distributing everywhere.** One well-planned long-form video becomes a week of multi-platform content. Invest in the production. Multiply through repurposing. Measure relentlessly.
