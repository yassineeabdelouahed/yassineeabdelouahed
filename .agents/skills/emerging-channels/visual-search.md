## Image Optimization Checklist for Visual Search

### Technical Image Requirements

| Factor | Requirement | Why It Matters |
|--------|------------|----------------|
| File format | WebP (preferred), JPEG, PNG | WebP provides best compression + quality balance |
| Resolution | Minimum 800x800px for products; 1200px+ for hero images | Higher resolution = better object recognition |
| File size | < 200KB (compressed) | Page speed affects ranking; lazy load below-fold images |
| Aspect ratio | Consistent per content type (1:1 for products, 16:9 for lifestyle) | Platform display consistency |
| Background | Clean white or light background for product images | Improves object isolation for visual search algorithms |
| Multiple angles | 4-8 images per product (front, back, side, detail, in-use) | More visual data = higher match probability |
| Alt text | Descriptive, keyword-rich, natural language | Primary text signal for visual search indexing |
| File name | Descriptive (blue-leather-crossbody-bag.webp, not IMG_4521.webp) | Secondary text signal for indexing |
| EXIF data | Include relevant metadata (remove personal GPS data) | Some platforms use EXIF for context |
| Lazy loading | Use `loading="lazy"` for below-fold images | Performance without sacrificing indexation |

### Image SEO Best Practices

| Element | Best Practice | Example |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| Alt text | Describe the image as if explaining to someone who cannot see it | `alt="Women's blue leather crossbody bag with gold chain strap"` |
| File name | Use hyphens, descriptive keywords, no underscores | `womens-blue-leather-crossbody-bag.webp` |
| Title attribute | Add supplementary context (not a duplicate of alt) | `title="Available in 6 colors — Free shipping"` |
| Caption | When visible captions are appropriate, include keyword-rich descriptions | Displayed under image on the page |
| Surrounding text | Ensure nearby text content is relevant to the image | Product description paragraph adjacent to product images |
| Image sitemap | Include all key images in your XML sitemap | `<image:image>` tags in sitemap.xml |
| CDN delivery | Serve images from a CDN for global performance | Cloudflare, CloudFront, Fastly |
