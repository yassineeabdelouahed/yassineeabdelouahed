# Voice Search — Optimization Guide

> Voice search now accounts for a significant and growing share of all search queries. The way people speak to devices is fundamentally different from how they type. This guide covers how to optimize content, structure data, and capture voice-driven traffic across every major platform.

## Voice Query Patterns

Voice queries differ from typed queries in predictable ways. Understanding these patterns is the foundation of voice search optimization.

### Query Type Comparison

| Attribute | Typed Search | Voice Search |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Length | 2-4 words | 6-10+ words (conversational) |
| Format | Keywords, fragments | Full sentences, questions |
| Intent signal | Implicit | Explicit (question words) |
| Example | "best Italian restaurant NYC" | "What's the best Italian restaurant near me that's open right now?" |
| Local intent | ~30% of queries | ~58% of queries |
| Action intent | Low | High ("call," "directions to," "order") |

### Common Voice Query Structures

| Pattern | Example | Optimization Target |
|---------|---------|-------------------|
| **Who** questions | "Who founded Tesla?" | Knowledge panel, Wikipedia, About pages |
| **What** questions | "What is the best CRM for small business?" | Featured snippet, listicle content |
| **Where** questions | "Where is the nearest pharmacy?" | Google Business Profile, local SEO |
| **When** questions | "When does Target close?" | Google Business Profile hours, schema |
| **How** questions | "How do I fix a leaky faucet?" | How-to schema, step-by-step content |
| **How much** questions | "How much does a roof replacement cost?" | FAQ content, pricing pages |
| **Can I / Is it** questions | "Can I return items to Costco without a receipt?" | FAQ pages, policy content |
| **Near me** queries | "Coffee shops near me" | Local SEO, Google Business Profile |
| **Action** queries | "Call Pizza Hut" / "Order from Amazon" | Business profile, voice commerce setup |

## Content Optimization for Voice

### Featured Snippet Optimization (Position Zero)

Voice assistants overwhelmingly pull answers from featured snippets. Winning Position Zero is the single most impactful voice search tactic.

| Snippet Type | Format | Optimization Approach |
|-------------|--------|----------------------|
| Paragraph | 40-60 word answer block | Answer the question directly in the first paragraph, then elaborate |
| List | Numbered or bulleted steps | Use H2/H3 with the question, follow with ordered/unordered list |
| Table | Structured comparison | Use HTML tables with clear headers |
| Video | YouTube result | Optimize video title as a question, add timestamps |

### Content Structure Rules for Voice

1. **Lead with the answer.** First 1-2 sentences should directly answer the target question
2. **Use question-based H2s and H3s.** Mirror the exact phrasing people use when speaking
3. **Write at an 8th-grade reading level.** Voice assistants favor concise, clear language
4. **Keep answer blocks to 40-60 words.** Google's preferred featured snippet length
5. **Include follow-up questions.** "People Also Ask" questions are voice search gold
6. **Use conversational language.** Write as if explaining to someone face-to-face

### FAQ Page Optimization

FAQ pages are one of the highest-value assets for voice search because they naturally align with question-and-answer format.

**Structure:**
```html
<section itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/FAQPage">
  <div itemscope itemprop="mainEntity" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question">
    <h3 itemprop="name">How much does roof replacement cost?</h3>
    <div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
      <p itemprop="text">The average roof replacement costs between $5,000 and $15,000
      depending on size, materials, and location. Asphalt shingles are the most affordable
      at $3-5 per square foot, while metal roofing ranges from $7-15 per square foot.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>
```

## Speakable Schema (JSON-LD)

The `speakable` schema tells search engines which sections of your page are most suitable for text-to-speech audio playback. This is especially relevant for Google Assistant and news content.

### JSON-LD Implementation

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "WebPage",
  "name": "How Much Does Roof Replacement Cost in 2025?",
  "speakable": {
    "@type": "SpeakableSpecification",
    "cssSelector": [
      ".article-summary",
      ".key-answer"
    ]
  },
  "url": "https://example.com/roof-replacement-cost"
}
```

### Speakable Content Guidelines
- Mark only concise, self-contained sections (not entire articles)
- Each speakable section should be under 2-3 sentences
- Avoid abbreviations, jargon, or visual-only references ("see the chart below")
- Write speakable sections as if they will be read aloud verbatim
- Include the most critical information — the answer, not the context

## Local Voice Search Optimization

Local intent dominates voice search. Over half of voice queries have local intent.

### Local Voice Search Checklist

|--------|----------|---------|
| Google Business Profile — complete and accurate | Critical | Every field filled: hours, categories, attributes, photos, services |
| NAP consistency | Critical | Name, Address, Phone identical across all directories |
| Local schema markup | High | LocalBusiness schema with geo-coordinates, hours, contact |
| "Near me" content optimization | High | Include neighborhood, city, and regional terms naturally in content |
| Reviews | High | Volume and recency directly impact local voice results |
| Apple Business Connect | Medium | Claim and optimize for Siri local queries |
| Bing Places | Medium | Claim and optimize for Alexa local queries |
| Local landing pages | Medium | City/neighborhood-specific pages with unique content |
| Q&A on Google Business Profile | Medium | Proactively add and answer common questions |

### Local Schema Example

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "LocalBusiness",
  "name": "Joe's Italian Kitchen",
  "address": {
    "@type": "PostalAddress",
    "streetAddress": "123 Main Street",
    "addressLocality": "Austin",
    "addressRegion": "TX",
    "postalCode": "78701"
  },
  "geo": {
    "@type": "GeoCoordinates",
    "latitude": 30.2672,
    "longitude": -97.7431
  },
  "telephone": "+1-512-555-0123",
  "openingHoursSpecification": [
    {
      "@type": "OpeningHoursSpecification",
      "dayOfWeek": ["Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday"],
      "opens": "11:00",
      "closes": "22:00"
    }
  ],
  "priceRange": "$$",
  "servesCuisine": "Italian"
}
```

## Analytics & Measurement

### Tracking Voice Search Performance

Voice search attribution is inherently challenging because voice queries don't appear distinctly in most analytics tools. Use these proxy methods:

| Method | What It Measures | How to Implement |
|--------|-----------------|------------------|
| Featured snippet tracking | Position Zero wins for question keywords | SEMrush, Ahrefs, or dedicated SERP tracker |
| Long-tail query analysis | Conversational query traffic in Search Console | Filter GSC for queries with 5+ words, question words |
| "Near me" query tracking | Local voice traffic proxy | GSC filter for "near me" queries |
| Google Business Profile insights | Calls, directions, website clicks from GBP | GBP dashboard |
| Smart speaker skills analytics | Alexa Skill usage | Platform-specific dashboards |
| Speakable impressions | Content read aloud by assistants | Google Search Console (limited) |

### Voice Search KPIs

| KPI | Definition | Target |
|-----|-----------|--------|
| Featured Snippet Ownership | % of target question keywords with Position Zero | >30% of tracked queries |
| Long-tail Question Traffic | Organic sessions from queries with 5+ words | Growing month over month |
| Local Action Rate | Calls + directions from GBP per month | Increasing quarter over quarter |
| FAQ Page Performance | Pageviews, time on page, bounce rate for FAQ content | Bounce rate <50%, time >1 min |
| Voice Commerce Revenue | Revenue attributed to voice-initiated purchases | Track via platform analytics |
| Bing Organic Traffic | Proxy for Alexa query performance | Stable or growing |
