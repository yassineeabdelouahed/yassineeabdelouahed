# Affiliate Marketing — Program Strategy

> **Benchmark provenance (as of 2026-08):** Dollar figures in this document are planning priors, not quotes — market and auction rates drift continuously. Before any figure enters a media plan, budget, or client deliverable, refresh it live (platform dashboards and current published reports beat memory) and record it with `python scripts/benchmark_book.py --action record ... --source <url>`; quote from the book thereafter (`--action quote`). Never present an unstamped figure as current market fact.

> Affiliate marketing is a performance-based channel where external partners (affiliates) promote your product in exchange for commissions on qualified actions. When structured well, it delivers predictable, profitable customer acquisition.

## Program Setup Guide

### Platform Selection

Choose between building in-house or using an affiliate network/platform.

| Approach | Pros | Cons | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|
| **In-house (custom build)** | Full control, no platform fees, custom attribution | Engineering investment, slower to launch, limited affiliate discovery | Companies with dev resources and existing partner relationships |
| **Affiliate SaaS platform** | Fast launch, built-in tracking, affiliate management tools | Monthly fees, some customization limits | Most companies launching their first program |
| **Affiliate network** | Access to large affiliate pool, built-in compliance, payment handling | Higher fees (network override), less control, commoditized | Companies wanting rapid scale through established affiliates |
| **Hybrid** | Combine in-house tracking with network distribution | Complexity of managing multiple systems | Mature programs optimizing for both control and reach |

| **CPA (Cost Per Acquisition)** | Flat fee per converted customer | $20-$200+ depending on ACV | SaaS with predictable LTV, defined conversion event |
| **Revenue share (recurring)** | Percentage of customer revenue, ongoing | 15-30% recurring | SaaS with monthly subscriptions, long LTV |
| **Revenue share (one-time)** | Percentage of first purchase only | 20-50% of first payment | E-commerce, one-time purchases |
| **Tiered commission** | Rate increases with volume | Base rate + escalators at thresholds | Motivating top affiliates to increase volume |
| **Hybrid (CPA + RevShare)** | Flat fee upfront + smaller ongoing percentage | $50 CPA + 10% recurring | Balancing affiliate motivation with program economics |
| **Performance bonuses** | Additional payouts for hitting milestones | Varies | Driving behavior during specific campaigns or periods |

### Commission Rate Calibration

| Competition for affiliates | Few competitors recruiting | Many programs competing for same affiliates |
| Product awareness | Well-known brand | Unknown brand needing introduction |

| **Best for** | Driving measurable conversions at scale | Building brand awareness and trust with specific audiences |

Result: Influencer is motivated to create AND promote; brand gets awareness AND conversions
```
