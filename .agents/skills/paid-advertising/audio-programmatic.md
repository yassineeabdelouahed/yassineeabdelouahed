# Audio Programmatic Advertising — Streaming, Podcasts & Digital Audio

> **Benchmark provenance (as of 2026-08):** Dollar figures in this document are planning priors, not quotes — market and auction rates drift continuously. Before any figure enters a media plan, budget, or client deliverable, refresh it live (platform dashboards and current published reports beat memory) and record it with `python scripts/benchmark_book.py --action record ... --source <url>`; quote from the book thereafter (`--action quote`). Never present an unstamped figure as current market fact.

    ↓ (frequency cap: 3x/week)
Touch 2 (Week 2): 15s consideration spot — social proof + differentiator
    ↓ (frequency cap: 2x/week)
Touch 3 (Week 3): 15s conversion spot — offer + clear CTA

## Measurement & Attribution

### Core Metrics

| Metric | Definition | Benchmark (Streaming) | Benchmark (Podcast) |

| **Completion Rate** | % who hear to the end | 85%+ (15s), 75%+ (30s) | 90%+ (mid-roll) |
| **Frequency** | Avg times a listener hears the ad | 3–5x/week optimal | 2–3x per listener per show |
| **Reach** | Unique listeners exposed | Varies by budget | Varies by show size |
| **CPM** | Cost per 1,000 impressions | $5–$15 (streaming) | $15–$50 (podcast) |
| **CPCV** | Cost per completed view/listen | $0.01–$0.03 | $0.02–$0.06 |
| **Brand Lift** | Awareness/consideration/intent change | 5–15% lift (average) | 10–25% lift (host-read) |

### Podcast Attribution Methods

| Method | How It Works | Accuracy | Ease |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Vanity URL** | brand.com/podcastname | Medium (some type direct) | Easy |
| **Promo Code** | Unique code per show/campaign | High (direct match) | Easy |
| **Pixel Attribution** | Spotify Ad Analytics (formerly Podsights), Podscribe pixel on site | High (impression-to-conversion) | Medium |
| **Post-Listen Survey** | "How did you hear about us?" | Low (recall bias) | Easy |
| **Branded Search Lift** | Monitor branded search volume during campaign | Medium (correlation) | Medium |
| **Household Graph** | Match podcast device to conversion device | High | Hard (requires partner) |

### Brand Lift Studies

Available through Spotify Brand Lift and Nielsen for campaigns with sufficient spend (typically $25K+):
- **Ad Recall:** "Do you remember hearing an ad for [brand]?" — Benchmark: 15–30% lift

## Cross-Channel Integration

### Audio in the Media Mix

| Strategy | How It Works | Expected Impact |
|---|---|---|
| **Audio → Display/Social Retarget** | Listeners who heard audio ad → retarget with visual creative | 20–40% higher display CTR from audio-primed audiences |
| **Audio + Video Sequential** | Audio ad (awareness) → Video ad (consideration) → Display (conversion) | Full-funnel coverage across contexts |
| **Audio + Search** | Audio drives branded search → capture with branded search ads | 15–25% branded search volume lift during audio flights |
| **Podcast + Email** | Podcast sponsor → drive to email signup → nurture sequence | High-quality leads from trusted host endorsement |
| **Streaming + CTV** | Audio ads during music → CTV ads during streaming video | Multi-format reach within same household |

### Frequency Capping Across Audio

- Spotify: Platform-level frequency caps (set in Ad Studio or via DSP)
- Podcast: Frequency is per-show; cross-show frequency requires programmatic buying via SAN or DSP
- Cross-platform: Use DSP (The Trade Desk, DV360) to manage frequency across streaming + podcast + CTV
- Recommended total audio frequency: 5–8 impressions per listener per week across all audio channels

## Audio Creative Best Practices

### What Works

- **Conversational tone** outperforms corporate/announcer voice by 20–30% in recall
- **Sound logos / mnemonics** (Intel bong, Netflix "ta-dum") build long-term brand recognition — invest in a 2–3 second audio signature
- **First 3 seconds must hook** — no "This ad is brought to you by..." openings (listeners tune out)
- **Personalization** (dynamic weather, location, time) increases recall 30%+ vs generic
- **Repetition of brand name** — mention brand name 2–3 times in a 30s spot (beginning and end minimum)
- **One message per spot** — do not try to cover multiple features or offers
- **CTA clarity** — simple, repeatable action ("visit brand dot com slash podcast" or "search for Brand in the app store")

### What Fails

- Starting with "Hey listeners" or generic greetings — feels like an interruption
- Sound effects louder than voice — jarring in headphone environments
- Multiple CTAs (visit website AND download app AND use promo code) — pick one
- Overly produced spots that sound nothing like the surrounding content
- 60-second spots without a compelling story — 30 seconds is the safe default
- Background music that competes with voice — keep it at -20 dB minimum

### Podcast Host-Read Guidelines

When briefing podcast hosts for host-read ads:
- [ ] Provide 3–5 key talking points, not a rigid script — hosts need to sound natural
- [ ] Include brand pronunciation guide and any terms to avoid
- [ ] Specify the one CTA (vanity URL or promo code)
- [ ] Share a 1-page brand brief with tone, audience, and key differentiator
- [ ] Allow hosts to use their own language and personal anecdotes
- [ ] Review and approve reads before air, or accept that baked-in reads cannot be edited
- [ ] Set clear FTC disclosure expectations ("This episode is sponsored by...")

> **Key principle:** Audio advertising succeeds when it respects the listener's environment. People listen to audio during personal, often intimate moments — commuting, working out, cooking, falling asleep. Ads that match the tone and context of these moments feel like natural companions rather than interruptions. The best audio ads sound like they belong.
