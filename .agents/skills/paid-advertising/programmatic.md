# Programmatic Advertising — DSP, CTV & DOOH

> **Benchmark provenance (as of 2026-08):** Dollar figures in this document are planning priors, not quotes — market and auction rates drift continuously. Before any figure enters a media plan, budget, or client deliverable, refresh it live (platform dashboards and current published reports beat memory) and record it with `python scripts/benchmark_book.py --action record ... --source <url>`; quote from the book thereafter (`--action quote`). Never present an unstamped figure as current market fact.

## Programmatic Ecosystem Overview

### How Programmatic Works
```
Advertiser → DSP → Ad Exchange → SSP → Publisher
     ↑                  ↑
     └── DMP ──────────┘ (Audience Data)
```

### Key Components

| Component | Role | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **DSP** (Demand-Side Platform) | Buys ad inventory on behalf of advertisers | DV360, The Trade Desk, Amazon DSP, Xandr |
| **SSP** (Supply-Side Platform) | Sells ad inventory on behalf of publishers | Google Ad Manager, Magnite, PubMatic, Index Exchange |
| **Ad Exchange** | Marketplace connecting DSPs and SSPs | Google AdX, OpenX, Xandr Marketplace |
| **DMP** (Data Management Platform) | Aggregates and segments audience data | Lotame, LiveRamp, Adobe Real-Time CDP |
| **CDP** (Customer Data Platform) | Unifies first-party customer data | Segment, mParticle, Tealium |
| **Ad Server** | Serves ads and tracks delivery/performance | Campaign Manager 360 (CM360), Innovid, Flashtalking |
| **Verification** | Brand safety, viewability, fraud detection | IAS, DoubleVerify, MOAT, Pixalate |

### Transaction Flow (RTB)
1. User visits a web page or opens an app
2. Publisher's SSP sends a bid request with user/context data to the exchange
3. Exchange forwards bid request to connected DSPs
4. DSPs evaluate user data, campaign criteria, and bid in real-time (<100ms)
5. Highest bidder wins the impression
6. Winning ad is served to the user
7. Impression, click, and conversion data flows back for optimization

## Audience Targeting Methods

| Method | Description | Data Source | Privacy Compliance |
|---|---|---|---|
| **First-Party Data** | Your own CRM, website, app data | CDP, CRM | Highest (consent-based) |
| **Contextual Targeting** | Target based on page content, not user | Real-time content analysis | Cookie-free, fully compliant |
| **Behavioral / Interest** | User browsing and purchase signals | DMP, DSP data marketplace | Requires consent; addressability reduced by Safari/Firefox blocking, iOS ATT, and consent regimes (Chrome retains third-party cookies — deprecation cancelled) |
| **Lookalike / Modeled** | Expand from seed audience using ML | DSP modeling, LiveRamp | Moderate; depends on seed data |
| **Geofencing / Location** | Target users in/near physical locations | Mobile location data (Foursquare, etc.) | Requires opt-in location services |
| **Seller-Defined Audiences** | Publisher-created audience segments | Publisher first-party data | High (publisher consent flow) |
| **Universal ID** | Cross-site identity without cookies | UID2, RampID, ID5, SharedID | Consent-based, industry-supported |

### Post-Cookie Strategy Checklist
- [ ] Prioritize first-party data collection (email, login, loyalty programs)
- [ ] Implement contextual targeting as primary scale driver
- [ ] Test Universal ID solutions (UID2 via TTD, RampID via LiveRamp)
- [ ] Evaluate seller-defined audiences from premium publishers
- [ ] Invest in Google Privacy Sandbox APIs (Topics, Attribution Reporting)
- [ ] Shift measurement from last-click to incrementality and media mix modeling

## Brand Safety & Fraud Prevention

### Brand Safety Framework

| Layer | Solution | What It Does |
|---|---|---|
| Pre-bid | IAS, DoubleVerify, Oracle Contextual | Blocks unsafe inventory before bidding |
| Inclusion lists | Curated publisher lists | Only buy from approved sources |
| Exclusion lists | Block lists by domain, app, category | Prevent ads on specific content |
| Content categories | GARM framework alignment | Block by risk category (misinformation, hate speech, etc.) |
| Keyword blocking | Custom keyword lists | Avoid pages with specific terms |
| Post-bid monitoring | IAS, DV, MOAT | Verify where ads actually ran |

### Ad Fraud Prevention

| Fraud Type | Description | Prevention |
|---|---|---|
| Bot traffic | Non-human impressions and clicks | Pre-bid fraud filtering (IAS, DV) |
| Domain spoofing | Fake sites mimicking premium publishers | Ads.txt / app-ads.txt verification |
| Ad stacking | Multiple ads layered in one slot | Viewability verification |
| Pixel stuffing | Ad served in 1x1 pixel | Viewability standards (MRC) |
| Click injection | Mobile apps generating fake clicks | App-ads.txt, SDK-level validation |

### Fraud Prevention Checklist
- [ ] Enable pre-bid fraud filtering on all campaigns
- [ ] Verify ads.txt / app-ads.txt for all publishers
- [ ] Set viewability targets: 70%+ (display), 70%+ VCR (video)
- [ ] Monitor invalid traffic (IVT) rates — flag if > 5%
- [ ] Review placement reports weekly for suspicious domains/apps
- [ ] Use PMPs or PG deals for highest-value campaigns

## Viewability Standards

| Standard | Display | Video |
|---|---|---|
| **MRC Standard** | 50% of pixels in view for 1 continuous second | 50% of pixels in view for 2 continuous seconds |
| **GroupM Standard** | 100% of pixels in view for 1 second | 100% of pixels in view, 50% duration |
| **Industry Target** | 70%+ viewability | 70%+ VCR |

### Viewability Optimization Tips
- [ ] Prioritize above-the-fold placements
- [ ] Use high-impact formats (interstitial, adhesion, in-read video)
- [ ] Avoid infinite scroll pages and below-fold standard display
- [ ] Set viewability targets in DSP (minimum 60%, target 70%+)
- [ ] Use verified viewability vendors for third-party measurement
- [ ] Consider attention metrics beyond viewability (eye-tracking, dwell time)

## Key Programmatic Benchmarks

| Metric | Display (Open Exchange) | Display (PMP) | Video (Pre-roll) | CTV | DOOH |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CPM | $1–$5 | $5–$15 | $10–$25 | $25–$45 | $5–$15 |
| CTR | 0.05–0.15% | 0.10–0.30% | 0.3–0.8% | N/A | N/A |
| Viewability | 50–65% | 65–80% | 70–85% | 95%+ | 90%+ (by design) |
| VCR | N/A | N/A | 65–80% | 90–97% | N/A |
| Fraud Rate | 5–15% | 2–5% | 3–8% | 1–3% | < 1% |

> **Note:** Programmatic benchmarks vary enormously by inventory source, deal type, targeting precision, and vertical. Open exchange carries the most variability. PMP and PG deals provide more predictable performance. Always layer verification vendors to ensure accuracy.
