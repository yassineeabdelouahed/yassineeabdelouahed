# Retail Media Networks — Amazon, Walmart & More

> **Benchmark provenance (as of 2026-08):** Dollar figures in this document are planning priors, not quotes — market and auction rates drift continuously. Before any figure enters a media plan, budget, or client deliverable, refresh it live (platform dashboards and current published reports beat memory) and record it with `python scripts/benchmark_book.py --action record ... --source <url>`; quote from the book thereafter (`--action quote`). Never present an unstamped figure as current market fact.

## Retail Media Landscape Overview

### What Are Retail Media Networks (RMNs)?
Retail media networks are advertising platforms built on top of retailer ecosystems. They leverage first-party shopper data (purchase history, search behavior, browsing patterns) to deliver ads at or near the point of purchase. This is the fastest-growing segment of digital advertising, now exceeding ~$150B globally.

### Why Retail Media Matters
- **First-party data**: Based on actual purchase behavior, not inferred interests
- **Closed-loop measurement**: See ad exposure through to purchase without attribution gaps
- **High purchase intent**: Shoppers are already in buying mode on retail platforms
- **Cookie-proof**: No reliance on third-party cookies or mobile IDs
- **Digital shelf influence**: Ads directly impact product visibility and organic ranking

## Budget Allocation Across Retail Media

### Budget Framework by Objective

| Objective | Sponsored Products | Sponsored Brands | Display / DSP | Offsite |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Launch new product | 60% | 20% | 15% | 5% |
| Grow market share | 40% | 25% | 20% | 15% |

| Brand awareness | 15% | 25% | 30% | 30% |
| Seasonal push | 50% | 25% | 15% | 10% |

### Budget Allocation by Platform (Multi-Retailer)

| Factor | Consideration |
|---|---|
| Revenue share by retailer | Allocate proportionally to where your sales already happen |
| Category competition | Higher investment where competition is fierce |
| Data availability | Invest more where measurement is most complete |
| Growth opportunity | Overweight emerging RMNs with less competition and lower CPCs |
| Incrementality | Shift budget toward platforms proving incremental lift |

### Minimum Viable Budgets

| Platform | Monthly Minimum (Testing) | Monthly Recommended |
|---|---|---|
| Amazon Ads (Sponsored) | $5,000 | $15,000–$50,000+ |
| Amazon DSP | $10,000 (managed) | $35,000+ |
| Walmart Connect | $3,000 | $10,000–$30,000 |

## Measurement Framework

### Key Retail Media Metrics

| Metric | Definition | Target Range | Why It Matters |
|---|---|---|---|
| **ACoS** (Advertising Cost of Sales) | Ad spend / attributed revenue | 15–30% (varies by category) | Core efficiency metric on Amazon |
| **ROAS** | Revenue / ad spend (inverse of ACoS) | 3x–7x | Universal efficiency metric |
| **TACoS** (Total ACoS) | Ad spend / total revenue (organic + paid) | 5–15% | Shows overall ad dependency |
| **New-to-Brand %** | % of conversions from first-time brand buyers | 40–70% (prospecting) | Measures true acquisition |
| **Share of Voice (SOV)** | % of top search results you own (paid + organic) | Varies by objective | Competitive position metric |
| **Conversion Rate** | Orders / clicks | 8–15% (Amazon SP average) | Listing and offer quality signal |
| **Impressions Share** | Your impressions / total available | 15–40% (category-dependent) | Market coverage |

### Measurement Checklist
- [ ] Set up Amazon Attribution for external traffic sources
- [ ] Configure AMC (Amazon Marketing Cloud) for cross-channel analysis
- [ ] Track TACoS alongside ACoS to monitor organic health
- [ ] Measure new-to-brand % for all prospecting campaigns
- [ ] Monitor SOV weekly using Brand Analytics or third-party tools (Helium 10, Jungle Scout)
- [ ] Compare ROAS across RMNs using consistent attribution windows
- [ ] Run incrementality tests (holdout markets or audiences) quarterly
- [ ] Report total retail media ROI to leadership monthly with blended ROAS

### Attribution Considerations
- Each RMN uses its own attribution model — they are not directly comparable
- Amazon: 14-day click attribution (Sponsored), 14-day click + 14-day view (DSP)
- Walmart: 14-day click attribution
- Standard caveat: all platforms over-attribute; cross-reference with sales data
- Use AMC or third-party tools (Pacvue, Skai, CommerceIQ) for unified reporting
- The most honest metric is TACoS: total ad spend relative to total sales on the platform

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

| Issue | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| High ACoS on Sponsored Products | Broad targeting, weak listing | Tighten match types, optimize listing content, negate irrelevant terms |
| Low impressions | Low bids, poor relevance, out of stock | Increase bids, ensure listing is indexed for target keywords, check inventory |
| High spend, low sales | Poor conversion rate | Optimize images, pricing, reviews; check competitor pricing |
| New-to-brand % declining | Retargeting existing customers | Shift budget to prospecting audiences, conquest campaigns |
| Budget not spending (Walmart/Instacart) | Low search volume, narrow targeting | Broaden targeting, add more keywords, increase bids |
| Share of voice declining | Competitor investment increasing | Increase investment on key terms, defend branded searches |
