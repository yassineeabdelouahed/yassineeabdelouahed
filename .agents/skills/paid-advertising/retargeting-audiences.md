| Email 3 | 48-72 hours | Email | Small incentive (if margins allow) |
| Retargeting ad | 72+ hours | Meta/Google Display | Discount offer or free shipping |

---

## Frequency Capping Guidelines

| Segment Intent Level | Recommended Frequency Cap | Rationale |
|---------------------|--------------------------|-----------|
| Very high (checkout abandoners) | 5-7 impressions/week | High conversion probability justifies frequency |
| High (cart abandoners, repeat visitors) | 4-6 impressions/week | Strong intent, avoid oversaturation |
| Medium (page visitors, category browsers) | 3-5 impressions/week | Balance between reminder and annoyance |
| Low (all visitors, content readers) | 2-3 impressions/week | Light touch to stay top of mind |
| Prospecting (lookalikes) | 2-3 impressions/week | Cold audience, focus on reach over frequency |

### Burn Pixels and Exclusions

A burn pixel is a tracking event placed on the conversion/thank-you page that triggers audience exclusion.

- [ ] Place burn pixels on all conversion confirmation pages
- [ ] Exclude purchasers from acquisition campaigns (save budget, reduce annoyance)
- [ ] Re-include purchasers only in cross-sell or loyalty campaigns
- [ ] Exclude employees via IP, email list, or company targeting exclusion
- [ ] Exclude existing customers from free trial or demo campaigns
- [ ] Exclude users who completed forms from lead gen retargeting
- [ ] Set maximum exposure caps per user across all campaigns (platform-level)

## Dynamic Retargeting Setup

### Product Catalog Requirements

| Platform | Feed Format | Key Attributes | Refresh Frequency |
|----------|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| Google Merchant Center | XML, TSV, CSV | id, title, description, image, price, availability, link | Every 6 hours minimum |
| Meta Catalog | CSV, XML, Google Sheets | id, title, description, image_link, price, availability, url | Daily minimum |
| TikTok Catalog | CSV, XML | sku_id, title, description, image_link, price, availability_status, landing_page_url | Daily minimum |

### Dynamic Ad Personalization Layers

| Layer | What Changes | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Product | Shows specific items the user viewed | "Still interested in the Blue Running Shoes?" |
| Category | Shows top products from browsed category | "Popular in Men's Running Shoes" |
| Price | Displays current price (including sales) | "$89.99 (was $129.99)" |
| Availability | Shows stock status | "Only 3 left in stock" |
| Social proof | Adds review stars or purchase count | "Rated 4.8/5 by 2,341 customers" |
| Recommendations | ML-driven cross-sell suggestions | "Customers also bought..." |

---

## Cross-Device Retargeting

### Matching Methods

| Method | Accuracy | Coverage | Requirement |
|--------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Deterministic (logged-in) | Very high (~95%) | Limited to logged-in users | User login across devices |
| Probabilistic (device graph) | Moderate (~60-70%) | Broader reach | Platform's device graph |
| Platform-native (Google, Meta) | High (~80-90%) | Platform-dependent | Platform tags + user logged in |
| Customer Match (email-based) | High | Limited to known users | Email list upload |
| First-party data (CDP) | High | Depends on data collection | CDP implementation |

### Cross-Device Strategy

- [ ] Ensure tracking tags fire on all devices (responsive site)
- [ ] Use Customer Match to unify known users across devices
- [ ] Enable Google Signals for cross-device GA4 reporting
- [ ] Implement Meta Conversions API (server-side) for better cross-device matching
- [ ] Design creatives for the device context (mobile-first creative for mobile retargeting)
- [ ] Attribute cross-device conversions in reporting (don't under-credit mobile)

## Privacy Impact on Retargeting

### Current Landscape

| Change | Impact | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|
| iOS ATT (App Tracking Transparency) | ~75% of iOS users opt out, reducing Meta audience sizes 30-40% | Active since iOS 14.5 |
| Third-party cookie deprecation | Cancelled — Chrome keeps 3P cookies (2024–2025 reversal); Safari/Firefox already block them | Closed |
| Privacy Sandbox (Google) | Topics API and Attribution Reporting API replace 3P cookies | Rolling out |
| GDPR/CCPA consent | Requires explicit consent for tracking in EU and California | Active |
| Email privacy (Apple MPP) | Apple Mail open rates inflated, can't reliably segment by opens | Active since iOS 15 |

### Adaptation Strategies

| Strategy | Implementation | Impact |
|----------|---------------|--------|
| First-party data collection | Email capture, account creation, loyalty programs | Build owned audience data |
| Server-side tracking | Conversions API (Meta), Enhanced Conversions (Google) | Recover 15-25% of lost signal |
| Contextual targeting | Target based on page content, not user history | Privacy-compliant alternative |
| Google Enhanced Conversions | Send hashed first-party data with conversion tag | Better attribution and audience building |
| Meta CAPI | Server-to-server event passing | Recover lost iOS events |
| Customer Match / Custom Audiences | Upload first-party lists for targeting | Cookie-independent targeting |
| Modeled conversions | Platform ML estimates conversions from partial data | Fill attribution gaps |

| Blog/content readers | Educational, thought leadership | Related content, deeper resources | "Read more" or "Download guide" |
| Past customers (recent) | Appreciative, exclusive | Complementary products, new arrivals | "Shop new arrivals" |
| Past customers (lapsed) | Win-back, personal | "We miss you" + incentive or what's new | "Come back and save" |
| High-value customers | VIP, exclusive | Early access, loyalty perks, premium | "Exclusive access" |
| Form abandoners | Reassuring, simple | Simplify the ask, address concerns | "It only takes 2 minutes" |
| Video viewers (75%+) | Direct, next-step | Deeper product/service information | "See how it works" |

## Measurement Framework

### Attribution Models for Retargeting

| Model | How It Counts | Best For | Watch Out For |
|-------|-------------|----------|---------------|
| Click-through (7-day) | Conversion within 7 days of click | Direct response, conservative measurement | Misses view-through influence |
| Click-through (28-day) | Conversion within 28 days of click | Longer consideration products | May over-credit if window is too long |
| View-through (1-day) | Conversion within 1 day of impression (no click) | Understanding full retargeting influence | Can over-credit for high-frequency campaigns |
| View-through (7-day) | Conversion within 7 days of impression | Brand awareness retargeting | Likely over-credits; use for directional data only |
| Data-driven attribution | ML-distributed credit across touchpoints | Holistic measurement across channels | Requires significant conversion volume |

### Incrementality Testing

To measure the true lift of retargeting (not just capturing conversions that would happen anyway):

1. **Holdout test** — Suppress retargeting ads for a random 10-20% of your audience for 2-4 weeks
2. **Measure the gap** — Compare conversion rates between exposed group and holdout group
3. **Calculate incremental lift** — (Exposed CVR - Holdout CVR) / Holdout CVR = true retargeting lift
4. **Typical finding** — Retargeting usually drives 10-30% incremental lift (not 100% of attributed conversions)
5. **Adjust ROAS expectations** — True retargeting ROAS is typically 40-70% of reported ROAS after incrementality

### Key Metrics to Track

| Metric | Definition | Benchmark Range |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| Frequency | Avg impressions per user per week | 3-7 (varies by segment) |
| Reach | Unique users in audience | Depends on site traffic |
| View-through conversions | Conversions after ad view, no click | 20-50% of total retargeting conversions |
| Audience decay rate | Drop in conversion rate as window lengthens | 40-60% drop from Day 1-7 to Day 14-30 |
| Incremental ROAS | Revenue from true incremental conversions / Ad spend | 3-8x for well-optimized retargeting |
| Audience overlap | % of users appearing in multiple segments | Keep <30% to avoid bid competition |

*Retargeting is not about following people around the internet. It is about delivering the right message to the right person at the right moment in their decision process. The best retargeting strategies feel helpful, not invasive, and they adapt to privacy changes by building first-party data foundations rather than relying on third-party cookies.*
