# Brand Safety — 4-Layer Protection Framework

> Protecting your brand from appearing alongside harmful, inappropriate, or off-brand content. One misplacement can undo years of brand building. This framework provides four layers of defense so that never happens.

---

## The 4-Layer Protection Model

```
Layer 4: Owned Content Safety        ← What you publish
Layer 3: Partner Safety               ← Who you associate with
Layer 2: Platform Safety              ← Where your ads appear
Layer 1: Content Adjacency            ← What appears next to your ads
```

Each layer addresses a different attack surface. Robust brand safety requires all four.

## Layer 1 — Content Adjacency

Content adjacency is the most common brand safety risk: your ad appearing next to objectionable content on publisher sites, YouTube videos, or social feeds.

### GARM-derived Brand Safety Categories (legacy industry framework)

*Note: GARM (Global Alliance for Responsible Media) wound down in August 2024, but its brand safety/suitability taxonomy remains the de facto reference used by platforms and verification vendors.*

| Category | Risk Level | Examples | Default Action |
|----------|-----------|----------|----------------|
| Adult & Explicit Sexual Content | High | Pornography, graphic sexual content | Block |
| Arms & Ammunition | High | Weapons sales, tactical gear | Block (most brands) |
| Crime & Harmful Acts | High | Violence promotion, illegal activity tutorials | Block |
| Death, Injury & Military Conflict | High | Graphic war footage, accident videos | Block |
| Online Piracy | High | Torrent sites, illegal streaming | Block |
| Hate Speech & Discrimination | High | Extremist content, slurs | Block |
| Obscenity & Profanity | Medium | Casual profanity in entertainment | Case-by-case |
| Illegal Drugs / Tobacco / Alcohol | Medium | Drug culture content, vaping promotion | Industry-dependent |
| Spam / Malware | High | Click farms, malicious sites | Block |
| Terrorism | High | Extremist propaganda | Block |
| Sensitive Social Issues | Medium | Political debates, social justice | Case-by-case |
| Misinformation | High | Fake news, conspiracy theories | Block |

### Keyword Exclusion Lists

**Universal Block List (apply to all campaigns):**
```
tragedy, shooting, terrorist, bomb, assault, murder, scandal,
arrest, abuse, trafficking, extremist, conspiracy, hoax,
pornography, explicit, hate crime, mass shooting, genocide,
drug overdose, suicide, self-harm
```

**News-Sensitive Block List (activate during breaking events):**
```
breaking news, developing story, crisis, emergency, disaster,
casualties, victims, manhunt, evacuation
```

**Political Block List (for brands avoiding political adjacency):**
```
election, candidate name, party name, impeach, ballot,
partisan, left-wing, right-wing, propaganda
```

> **Important:** Overly aggressive keyword blocking can tank reach. Review block lists quarterly and monitor impression loss vs. safety trade-off.
