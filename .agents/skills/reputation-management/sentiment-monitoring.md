# Sentiment Monitoring — Setup & Reporting

> **Benchmark provenance (as of 2026-08):** Dollar figures in this document are planning priors, not quotes — market and auction rates drift continuously. Before any figure enters a media plan, budget, or client deliverable, refresh it live (platform dashboards and current published reports beat memory) and record it with `python scripts/benchmark_book.py --action record ... --source <url>`; quote from the book thereafter (`--action quote`). Never present an unstamped figure as current market fact.

> Continuous monitoring of how your brand, competitors, and industry are perceived across the internet. Early detection of sentiment shifts is the difference between proactive reputation management and crisis firefighting.

## Sentiment Scoring Methodology

### Automated Sentiment Classification

| Score Range | Label | Definition | Example |
|-------------|-------|-----------|---------|
| 0.8 - 1.0 | Very Positive | Enthusiastic praise, strong recommendation | "Absolutely love this product, best purchase I've made!" |
| 0.5 - 0.79 | Positive | General satisfaction, mild praise | "Good product, works as expected." |
| 0.2 - 0.49 | Neutral | Factual mention, no clear sentiment | "I bought their product last week." |
| -0.2 - 0.19 | Mixed | Contains both positive and negative elements | "Great features but the support is terrible." |
| -0.5 - -0.21 | Negative | Dissatisfaction, complaint | "Disappointed with the quality, not worth the price." |
| -1.0 - -0.51 | Very Negative | Anger, outrage, intent to harm brand | "This company is a scam, DO NOT buy from them." |

### Manual Sentiment Calibration

Automated tools are typically 70-85% accurate. Improve accuracy with:

1. **Train the model:** Most tools allow you to correct misclassified mentions — do this weekly for the first month
2. **Context rules:** Create rules for sarcasm-heavy industries (e.g., gaming, fashion)
3. **Weight by reach:** A negative mention from someone with 500K followers matters more than one from 50
4. **Exclude noise:** Filter out job postings, stock tickers, unrelated name matches
