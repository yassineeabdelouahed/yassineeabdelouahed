 * page-format.mjs — one owner for paper size.
 *
 * The accepted values, the project default, the body width each one implies, the
 * CSS `@page size` keyword each one maps to, and the rule that ranks the ways a
 * format can be chosen. One owner, so the answer cannot depend on which script
 * the document came through.
 *
 * It used to. `build-cv-html.mjs` fell back to letter's `8.5in` body width while
 * `generate-pdf.mjs` fell back to `a4` in three places and
 * `generate-cover-letter.mjs` in a fourth. A payload declaring
 * `page_format: "letter"` was therefore laid out 8.5in wide and printed onto a
 * 210mm sheet, and modes/pdf.md had to tell the user to "Pass the SAME value" to
 * two scripts by hand. Page size is not in the filename and the PDF opens fine
 * either way, so a mismatched CV reaches a recruiter unnoticed.
 *
 * Resolution order, one direction:
 *
 *   explicit --format / payload page_format
 *     -> config/profile.yml `page_format`
 *       -> DEFAULT_PAGE_FORMAT
 *
 * A user states the size once in their profile instead of remembering a flag on
 * every render.
