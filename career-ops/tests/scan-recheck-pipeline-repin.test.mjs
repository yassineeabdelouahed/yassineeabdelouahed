// tests/scan-recheck-pipeline-repin.test.mjs — `scan_history.recheck_after_days`
// must actually release a row, and must not release one that is still queued.
//
// collectSeenUrls builds the seen-set from three sources. Only the first,
// scan-history.tsv, consults the age policy; pipeline.md and applications.md are
// parsed with no policy at all. Every URL in scan-history that has ever been
// queued is also in pipeline.md, so a row the TTL released was re-pinned a few
// lines later and the window freed nothing on any install with a pipeline —
// which is every install past its first run. The counter said otherwise: it was
// incremented at the release site, before the two later sources could pin the
// row again, so it reported rows as "eligible again" that the same call had
// already put back in the set.
//
// The release cannot be unconditional, and that is the other half of the
// invariant. A `- [ ]` row under ## Pending is a line the user can still pull
// from: re-scanning it appends a SECOND copy of a job already on the list. Only
// finished work — `- [x]`, or anything under ## Processed — is safe to hand back
// to the TTL, and only when scan-history is what released it. A pipeline-only
// URL has no scan-history row to have released it, so it stays pinned whatever
// its checkbox says.
