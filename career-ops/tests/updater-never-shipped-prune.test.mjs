/**
 * updater-never-shipped-prune.test.mjs — the stale-file prune must not delete a
 * file upstream has NEVER shipped.
 *
 * `staleSystemFiles()` selects on "absent from upstream's current tree", which
 * cannot distinguish a file upstream retired from a file upstream never
 * carried. Under the ~50 directory-prefix SYSTEM_PATHS entries (`providers/`,
 * `tests/`, `templates/`, `docs/`, `modes/<lang>/`, ...) that second case is any
 * file a fork or contributor added, and `apply()` deleted it on every update
 * (#3971 — same root cause as #3636 / #3696, on a surface where no USER_PATHS
 * carve-out applies and no filename shape distinguishes the file).
 *
 * `wasEverShippedUpstream()` settles it from upstream's history, which
 * `apply()` has already fetched. These tests pin the four behaviours that
 * matter: never-shipped is kept, retired-upstream still prunes, a moved file
 * still prunes via its old path, and an unusable history keeps the file.
