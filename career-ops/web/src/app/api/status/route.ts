// Writeback: UPDATE the status cell of an EXISTING tracker row only. Never adds
// rows — per the core data contract, new rows go through the TSV + merge flow.
//
// This route used to read data/applications.md, rewrite the Status cell in
// memory and atomically write the file back. It was the only tracker writer
// that took no lock: atomicWrite is atomic about the *file*, not about the
// read-modify-write around it, so a change committed by merge-tracker.mjs or
// set-status.mjs between the read and the write was silently overwritten by a
// copy of the tracker that predated it (#2900).
//
// So it delegates. set-status.mjs is the path every other writer already uses:
// it holds the shared tracker lock across the whole read-modify-write,
// validates the state against templates/states.yml, and appends the transition
// ledger. Routing through it closes the race, drops this file's duplicate
// Status-column detection, and produces the ledger row as a consequence of the
// write rather than as a second writer racing beside it. `--source web` keeps
// rows written from here distinguishable in the ledger.
//
// What stays here is the HTTP contract: reject a bad request before spawning
// anything, and map the CLI's exit codes onto status codes.

// then get killed by the timeout above — reported as a crash — instead of the
// 503 the contended case should produce. Bounding the child's wait below our
// own kill timeout lets its exit-4 path actually fire, so a busy tracker comes
// back as "retry shortly" in a few seconds.
//
// An operator's own value is honored only while it stays under the ceiling.
// Above it the two settings contradict each other — the child would still be
// waiting when we kill it — and the result is not a longer wait but the loss of
// the lock-timeout signal entirely.
