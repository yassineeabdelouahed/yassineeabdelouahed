/**
 * planner.ts - spawn the read-only planner CLI and collect what it wrote.
 *
 * Moved out of api/apply/prefill/route.ts unchanged. The route is a streaming
 * NDJSON handler wrapped around ~50 lines that are not about streaming at all:
 * choosing the CLI's argv, scaling the kill timer to the form size, and draining
 * stdout/stderr with a heartbeat. Those are planner concerns, and a second
 * caller cannot reuse them while they sit inside a ReadableStream's start().
 *
 * Everything here is a relocation. The argv, the Claude carve-out and its
 * reasoning, the timeout formula, the heartbeat interval, and the resolve-on-
 * error behaviour are byte-for-byte what the route did.
 *
 * The planner's permissions live here too (#2507): the capability record it
 * runs under, the derived Claude deny list, the unfenced-runtime notice and the
 * fencing refusal all moved with the spawn, so a second caller inherits the
 * same fence instead of re-spelling it.
