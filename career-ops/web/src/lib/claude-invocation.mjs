/**
 * claude-invocation.mjs — how a headless `claude` run is invoked: which tools each
 * web worker kind may use, and the argv that carries that decision (#2185).
 *
 * Everything here is asserted on as VALUES (test-all.mjs §55.6), never by matching
 * route.ts's source: five source-text versions of that guard were each defeated by
 * rewriting the route around them while pdf kept full write access. So the argv is
 * built here — `claudeCliArgs({kind:"pdf"})` IS the command line — and the only
 * rule left on the route is that it may spell no tool flag itself.
 *
 * The transport flags (`--output-format stream-json`, `--include-partial-messages`)
 * live here too, because route.ts's NDJSON parser depends on them and a guard can
 * only be honest if it inspects ONE shipped argv.
 *
 * `disallowedTools` is the hard guardrail; the allow list is the working set. Every
 * write-capable tool a kind does not need is EXPLICITLY denied, never merely
 * omitted: `--permission-mode acceptEdits` exists to auto-approve edit tools, so
 * "unmentioned" is the one status a file-writing tool must never have. The deny
 * lists are derived from the allow lists for that reason — hand-writing them once
 * left MultiEdit unmentioned for the persisting kinds.
