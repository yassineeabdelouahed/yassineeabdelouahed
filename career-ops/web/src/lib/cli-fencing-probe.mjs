/**
 * cli-fencing-probe.mjs — ask a CLI binary whether it supports the flags
 * cli-fencing.mjs would fence it with (#2361, #2507).
 *
 * Membership in cli-fencing's FENCERS table answers "can this RUNTIME be
 * restricted". It cannot answer "can the binary on this machine be restricted":
 * flags move between releases, and a `codex` old or new enough to have dropped
 * one would take the fencing flags, ignore them, and run wide open. This module
 * is that second question, and it fails closed — an unreadable binary, a timed
 * out probe or a missing flag all mean "unsupported", never a weaker invocation.
 *
 * Separate file rather than part of cli-fencing.mjs for one hard reason: probing
 * means spawning, and cli-fencing.mjs is imported by worker-card.tsx, a client
 * component. A `node:child_process` import there would follow it into the browser
 * bundle. The flag lists it checks are still cli-fencing's, imported below, so
 * the two cannot drift apart.
 *
 * It spawns directly rather than through spawnHeadlessCli, which requires a
 * capability record and would fence the argv: `--help` runs no prompt, no model
 * and no tools, so there is nothing to fence, and routing it through the agent
 * spawn path would also make cli-fencing ↔ spawn-cli a cycle. stdin is closed
 * here for the same reason spawnHeadlessCli closes it.
