// Shared urgency-selection logic for the DEMAND-loop home dashboard (#86).
//
// followup-cadence.mjs is the single source of truth for cadence: it already
// classifies every actionable application into an `urgency` of 'urgent',
// 'overdue', 'waiting', or 'cold' (see computeUrgency in followup-cadence.mjs,
// and its own --overdue-only filter, which treats 'urgent'/'overdue' as due).
// The web route used to filter on `e.status` (the tracker status —
// applied/responded/interview — never "overdue"/"urgent") instead of
// `e.urgency`, so the filter always matched nothing and silently fell back to
// showing the raw top entries regardless of urgency. This module is the one
// place that decision is made, so the route and any future consumer agree.
//
// Plain .mjs (not .ts) so the root test suite can import it without a build,
// mirroring followup-seed.mjs.
