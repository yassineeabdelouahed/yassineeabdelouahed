/**
 * ACL for the core's tracker lock (`tracker-utils.mjs`).
 *
 * WHY A WEB ROUTE NEEDS IT. `atomicWrite` makes the WRITE atomic, not the
 * read-modify-write around it. Two writers each read the whole tracker, each
 * edit their own row, each rename their full copy back: the second discards the
 * first's change. Every call succeeds, the file is well-formed at every instant,
 * and one row silently reverts (#2900). Reproduced before fixing:
 *
 *   row 1 → Applied     (wanted Applied)
 *   row 2 → Evaluated   (wanted Interview)   ← lost, no error anywhere
 *
 * The other writer is not hypothetical: the web exists to be used ALONGSIDE the
 * CLI, and `set-status.mjs`, `mark-pdf-ready.mjs` and `reserve-report-num.mjs`
 * all take this lock already.
 *
 * NOT `run-registry`'s acquireTrackerWrite(): that is an in-memory counter which
 * tells this process whether a run is in flight. It cannot see another process.
 * Two guards, different scopes — the reason this survived review is that the
 * route looked protected.
 *
 * THE LOCK IS NOT REENTRANT (checked: no owner/pid self-check in
 * tracker-utils.mjs). So a caller holding it must never invoke a core script
 * that takes it too — that self-deadlocks until the timeout. Direct writers only.
 *
 * A crashed holder does NOT wedge the tracker: `lockCanRecover` reads the
 * owner's pid and recovers when that process is gone. But a LIVE process that
 * leaks the lock (a throw with no `finally`) keeps its pid alive, so recovery
 * waits out staleMs — hence the mandatory `finally` in withTrackerLock.
