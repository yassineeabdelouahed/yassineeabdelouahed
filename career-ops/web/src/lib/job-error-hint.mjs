// Classifies WHY a worker job ended in error and picks the matching hint.
// Reads ONLY the job's terminal step label — the exact, structured message
// job-store.tsx (client) or /api/run (server) set when the run ended — never
// the free-form assistant output. Scanning accumulated assistant text used to
// false-positive: career-ops evaluates AI/tech job postings, so the output
// routinely contains words like "credential", "sign-in", "authenticate" as
// ordinary JD/CV prose, unrelated to whether the CLI itself is signed in.
//
// Terminal labels this classifies against (see job-store.tsx / api/run/route.ts):
//   Real not-configured / auth failure -> "auth":
//     "No CLI configured — open Config"                                   (job-store.tsx, no cliId)
//     raw CLI stderr matched for auth keywords                            (api/run/route.ts stderr handler)
//     "The CLI exited with an error — is it installed and authenticated?"
//     "The CLI produced no output — is it installed and authenticated? (...)"
//   Connection dropped mid-stream, CLI never got a chance to fail -> "connection":
//     "Connection error"                                                  (job-store.tsx)
//   Page reload orphaned a running job -> "interrupted":
//     "Interrupted (page reloaded)"                                       (job-store.tsx restore effect)
//   Everything else (bad input, missing CV, no report written, etc.) -> null;
//   the error text itself is the explanation.

// "auth" as a bare substring matched inside unrelated words like "author" —
// career-ops evaluates AI/tech job postings, so a terminal label can
// legitimately read something like "Failed to parse author metadata".
// authenticat\w* matches authenticate/authenticated/authentication (the
// actual terminal-label forms listed above) without matching author/authority.
