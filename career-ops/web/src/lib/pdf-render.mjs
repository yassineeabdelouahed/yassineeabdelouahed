/**
 * pdf-render.mjs — render a tailored CV to PDF and mark the tracker (#2172).
 *
 * Plain .mjs (same pattern as pdf-paths.mjs / clean-chips.mjs) so this can be
 * unit-tested with `node --test`, no TypeScript build step. `spawnFn`,
 * `execPath`, and `root` are injected rather than importing node:child_process
 * or career-ops.ts directly, keeping this module free of TypeScript
 * dependencies and letting tests substitute a fake child process.
 *
 * Runs generate-pdf.mjs and mark-pdf-ready.mjs as plain Node child processes
 * — no agent CLI or its sandbox involved — so a browser launch never depends
 * on an interactive sandbox-escalation approval nobody is present to grant in
 * a headless/web-triggered run. The tracker is marked ✅ only after a
 * CONFIRMED successful render, never optimistically.
