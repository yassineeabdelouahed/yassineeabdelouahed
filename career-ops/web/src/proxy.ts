// Single choke point over the API surface. Every /api request is gated on the
// same-origin + loopback guard before it can reach a route handler (which may
// spawn a child process or write the user's files). See origin-guard.mjs for
// the two-layer rationale (F1 drive-by CSRF, F2 LAN reachability).
//
// Opt in to extra hosts (e.g. a trusted LAN box) with a comma/space separated
// CAREER_OPS_WEB_ALLOWED_HOSTS; unset means loopback only.
//
// Opt in to extra *origins* the same way with CAREER_OPS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS;
// unset means none, which is the default and leaves the guard as strict as it
// was. It is what a local companion client needs: a browser extension calls
// from a chrome-extension:// origin, which Fetch Metadata always reports as
// "cross-site", so every one of its requests is refused otherwise.
