// Tests for the Today page's "Awaiting your decision" card list.
//
// The behaviour under test is the one that used not to exist: before this,
// the page took `applications.filter(isEvaluated).slice(0, 6)` with no sort,
// so the six cards were whichever six sat first in data/applications.md.
// #3529 made merge-tracker re-sort that file by # on every write, which would
// have changed the card set with no change to this component.
//
// Run:  node --test tests/lib/awaiting-order.test.mjs
