// Tests for the CLI fencing capability probe (#2361, #2507).
//
// The probe is a gate: it decides whether the binary on THIS machine supports
// the flags cli-fencing.mjs would restrict it with. Every case here therefore
// asks the same thing from a different angle — does an answer other than a
// verified "yes" come back as "unsupported"? A probe that guessed "supported"
// would hand a user an unsandboxed agent while the UI reported a fenced one.
//
// The flag-semantics cases read helpSatisfiesFencing directly, over help text
// written inline. That is not merely convenient: producing help from a fixture
// needs an executable, and a shebang script is executable on POSIX and inert on
// Windows, so fusing the two would leave the matching rules — the half a review
// has already found bugs in — untested on the platform whose CI runs them.
//
// Run:  node --test tests/lib/cli-fencing-probe.test.mjs
